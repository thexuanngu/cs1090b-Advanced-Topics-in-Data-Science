will someone come rescue me?

far away from a normal town
feel so lost, starting to drown
i know who's done this me
not the work of a mortal being

lifted high above me

tell me where can i run?

still have so far to go
escaped their clutch; that i know
are they coming after me?
do i have a chance to flee?

another caught and now is gone

chosen to prevail and remember what once was

only for the angels and for me
i escaped the truth and the lies
forced my soul to depart with my body

gazing out into that cold and rainy street

will i ever see the curtain fall

there is unchained magic in the air
it's right before me on a transparant plane
juggling with a liquid substance
is it a final test i have to break through
which way am i supposed to chose

i will burn it all down and watch it glow in the dark
i know i have done wrong, but so shall it be

we had wished for a savior

reality can't really be as bad as it seems
i hope for something better but i'm waiting for the worst
and when i open up my eyes i see the bubble burst
all my dreams are broken as the world is torn apart
was it really meant to be this way right from the start
if this is all we live for then i wish that i was dead
just so i could stop these thoughts from going through my head
i close my eyes
i close my eyes
i close my eyes
i close my eyes
i close my eyes again and wish that everything was fine
even though i know that i'm just wasting precious time
i'm loosing my direction life is driving me insane
the more things keep on changing the more they stay the same
so please somebody catch me before i hit the ground
i just can't understand what makes this crazy world go round
the more i look around me the less i seem to know
if this is all there is then i don't know where i can go
i close my eyes

i close my eyes and wish that i could press rewind
i close my eyes and wish that i could change my mind
i close my eyes and wish that everything was fine
i close my eyes one final time to make my vision clear
the more i try the more my vision seem to disappear
the world keeps turning around as i turn my inside out
i'm doing all i can to understand what life's about
but everywhere i seem to look the answer isn't there
nobody's asking questions 'cause' nobody seems to care
there has to be some sort of meaning and a reason to exist
if this is all there is there must be something that i missed

you always take your share, no more no less
and when you've had your turn, there's always something left
for whoever's next, behind you in the line
when there's work to do, you always spare some time
you work your hands to the bone, but you don't complain
you never push up front, just for your personal gain
this goes out to all the zeros, to my personal heros
all the losers and zeros, you're my personal heroes,
this goes out to all the zeros
you never do no wrong, you never hurt no one
you always tell yourself, the best is yet to come
no matter how things look, how bad it all may seem
you always stand your ground, and live by your means
you work your hands to the bone, but you don't complain

but you're the one paying the price
and the only thing left will be a hole in your pocket
when everyone else gets their slice/has been given their slice
where are you now, what have you done
what have you got left, what have you become
you had the world in your hands but it slipped through
your fingers and now look at what you've become
the masterplan wasn't yours you were just the excuse
to squeeze out some juice from the fruit
and nobody cares about your personal life
all you are is the latest recruit
the sweet smell of success has a foul aftertaste
and when you've lost your place in the sun
what you won't do for you love you just do for money
so you'd best take the money you can and then run

i'm two steps away from just killing myself because i'm sick and tired of being the prey
but when i'm dead everything that i've said will loose it's meaning and fade to grey
i'm not ready for that i'd rather counterattack instead of leaving my own song unsung
because i'm too young to die and i can never justify not breathing air into my lunges
i'll take one more step until somebody stops me
i'll take one more step until somebody stops me
i'll take one more step until somebody stops me
i'll take one more step until somebody stops me

how can i believe a single word you say when i know you've got a card up your sleeve

i've given you a thousand chances but you still won't learn
and i've seen a thousand signs that you've been missin'
i've told you a thousand times wait until your turn
you always help yourself, to what you can find
but sharing what there is, it doesn't cross your mind
you find a place in the sun and wait until you're served
to make sure that you get, more than you deserve

i-guess-i-ll-never-know,2006,clawfinger,"after all these precious years you chose to just give in
why did you leave so many things undone
i only scratched the surface of the thoughts you had within
and for me your life had just begun
why did you think that you were never good enough to give
when you accepted me right from the start
i never saw the side of you that didn't want to live
and i miss you from the bottom of my heart
what was it that you never told a soul about yourself
what kind of thoughts were buried inside
was there really no one there you thought would understand
or was the only barrier your pride
with so much love around you i just wish you'd loved yourself
'cause no one here can ever take your place
you were someone special and my words just can't express
how much i miss the warmth of your embrace
why did you just give in
why did you just give up and let it go
i guess i'll never know
it's hard to see you disappear without a real good bye
there's so many things i wish i'd said
but all the little things you did that made it all worthwhile
meant more than all the tears you ever shed
you always seemed so happy but i guess no one can tell
what goes on inside a persons mind
you loved your children dearly and you did your very best
and someone new like you is hard to find
chorus
all the things you went through for your children every day
and all the sacrifices that you made
were worth much more than anything that wealth could ever buy
and now that love can never be repaid
in the end i guess you couldn't take it anymore

i've fixed all the broken things that you couldn't mend
i've taken all the chances what you never even took
and i've found the things you overlooked
i'm the answer to your questions, i'm belief when you're in doubt
i'm based on a rumor, i'm spread by word of mouth
there's no proof of my existence i'm the myth that you arouse
i'm your life and religion, your faith and your hope
your drug and your addiction, your injection of dope
i've meet all the people that you never dared to meet
i've played all the games of life and never once been beat
i've walked upon the water without even getting wet
and there's not a thing that i regret
i've done everything that's wrong and made it right again
i've talked to all my enemies and turned them into friends
i've been crucified and resurrected from the dead
do you believe a single word i've said?

but i wasn't paying attention to the statement being made
and when i looked up at a banner and saw just what it said
then i wished that i was somewhere else instead
because the message on the banner was for white supremacy
and no matter how hard i tried it didn't make any sense to me
so i studied the people around me trying to think of what to say
but the only thing i could think of was to laugh and walk away
i was dreaming that i was talking to a man about his faith
and i was far away from home in some kind of exotical place
the situation was such that when i looked at my surrounding
i got nervous and my heart just started pounding
i realized that i was the only man that was caucasian
all the people around me looked like oriental asian
i was a legal alien in a difficult situation
but i could relate to the state i was in when i thought about discrimination

i was dreaming that i was at home and when i took a look around
it was as if the entire population had suddenly gone underground
i was standing all by myself and there was no one to be found
the only thing worse than a terrible noise is not even hearing a sound
there wasn't a trace of a human face as far as my eyes could see
i started to feel kind of lonely and i wanted some company
i had to make do with myself and the thought didn't appeal to me
'cause the only thing worse than to many people is feeling completely lonely
was i in the wrong place at the wrong time

anybody could be related with a monkey in a tree
or an ancient tribe from africa but that doesn't bother me
i've probably got lots of relatives that are jews and nobody knows
maybe that's the reason for the size of my big and beautiful nose
my family tree is a mystery that comes from all over the place

the body amorphous? and sounds?
streams carrying upwards
once hands the wings are now.
you were longing for soaring like eternity
higher and higher fly for your life
scorn all the principles
dictated above
but is there an aim you head for?
you wanted it pure, but is it?
are you certain in it giving all your strench
to the upwards inviting space?
if sure, then fly and break all the bars
the call of your heart, it won't disappoint
and the sky will accept a proud bird
but the main thing for her is not to fall
but the proud bird doesn't hear the words
that all that invites is not a good sign
and the main aim for her is to merge
with the space to which she aspires."

the fire that absorbed us
appealing to you who subdued me

how i attracted you dazzling feelings
and your flared up love
before i saw you from afar
but now i'm in you

our world is for us
and the horizon we change
is the display of our piercing,
stormy and rainy feelings
our embraces are eternal
our fire is never dying away
our hope is great, we're one
our war is inside us
and no one will understand us
for our love is beyond the space
where our life we create
exploding skies our feelings' display
our emotions are the hurricane

our sun and where once an arcane cage gripped me, my soul, now i could

who're every night without you

and tell you all the things i really feel
but watching you beside me
the silence tells the truth
we know that it's forever and for real

as i drink from a cup of my life
just bring me back
all the games from the childhood
the power to believe
that eternity is coming to us
on the wings of tired flocks
my soul will travel
will i ever find my way
from here to eterity?
falling asleep...
while autumn leaves cover me
in the dark night...
with candles i'm burning free!
another dawn, sun is rising again
but i know it will set
by the end of the day
give me all - keys of eternity

in the infinite universe

to find some answers and reach out the sky.

which take me up beyond the time...
where awareness and dreams become the same
beyond the start and the end!
messages, signs and the magic
in the air - the vision starts.

games of fantasy - maze of a genius."

ode-to-solitude,2007,estatic-fear,"wandering restless through the hillside on a cold december day, my solitary journey guided only by the pilgrims high in the sky.
fog invades the lands blocking the last rays of the dying sun and a veil of mist and serenity gracefully covers the night.
the shadowy trees of the forest, once imbued with beauty and life now twisted and eternally frozen by a shroud of snow and ice.
as the glow of the dawning sun vanishes in the witherd sky my eyes wander up through the whispering winds and watch the glare of the stars dilute.
exposed to the frost of the icy winds my bittered soul still rejoys.
as the howl of the wind enchants me more than the sweetest sounding human voice.
freed from mens insanity i feel my grief stricken heart still burn bracing my soul through night's loneliness i sence a glimpse of shelter return.
burdend with the insight of my loneliness i continue my journey through this night.
passed have the times when the glimmer of hope filled my heart with gentle delight.
all the years that the currents of fortune have planted the seeds of my grief my eyes have been fooled by the masks of joy, my desperate hopes deceived.
so let us now gather the harvest of the past solitary days.
and bath our peace craving eyes in sin's magnificent grace.
the night shall pass and a cold morning breeze shall obscure the traces of my pittyful existence.
for not a stone shall mark the place where silence embraced me and guided my cheerful soul into the charm of everlasting solitude."

words will be their guide
their fates brought them into these point

their fates will show them the way

i sleep and awake in the world of dreams
awake in a common reality, but it is not the same for everyone
i have to dwell between a permanent and a changing world
that is driving me to the edge
to open the doors that cross in my way
beyond each a quest to be fulfilled
to reach the control of that forgotten world
that is left behind, they all denied
the rays of light that gave birth to the world
show me the body that hides beyond the cover of the skin
my hand is writing words that i don't even know
in a foreign language brought to me by a crow
emissary of the lands far beyond our law
he is the one that possesses the virtue
for ruling the realms

watch my hands to regain the form of the sleeping body
watch the mist fade away and discover the realms of the infinite sea
canvas of pictures of my live that changes in a violent motion
to open the doors....

our heads full of knowledge our ways full of mirth.
we know all the answers to questions unasked,
we live in the light with no fear of the dark.
it must be said we have dark evil breeds,
who plague mankind with their mischievous deeds,

do not cut it down with the axe that you wield,
it coarses magic from branch to root,
and woe to he who eats its fruit.

from faerie magic cast long ago,
therefore we bid you to let it stand,
ill fortune to those who ignore our command.

in the dead of night see us dance on the hills,
on fiddles and flutes we play jigs and reels.

burst organs jellified simmering in boiling lard
smoking slab of blackened burnt meat
scent of immolation, sickeningly sweet...
horrifying corpses posed by flame
muscles constricted, melted, and maimed
postures assumed from the singing heat
posthumous pugilistic athletes...
muscle fiber twisted, gnarled, and hard
scorched arms in a feeble boxer's guard
superheated flesh chips excoriate and flake
from this repulsive side of cooked human steak...
hardened skin dulls my blades

tangled remains of this funeral pyre

y-shaped-thoracoabdominalincision,2007,the-county-medical-examiners,"...alphabetic diagram...
...of the gross exam...
medical examiners are detectives, who forensically
sift through a body of evidence
it's rarely simple, as you can see...the organs are on
the inside
we open up the corpse to find the clues that point to
an explanation that might make sense
let's crack the cadaver open for a little peek and
document what we find...
...with scalpel in hand...
...i hatch the plan...
whether man, woman, child-the procedure is always the
same
beginning the medicolegal autopsy isn't very hard
the thoracoabdominal incision is the name of this
turgidly morbid game
and the letter ""y"" is the shape that we must carve...
all me's worth their salt keep a blade of their own
and have their scalpel professionally sharpened,
polished, and honed
because of its ability to cut through skin, meat,
gristle, and bone
we keep track of it from the opening of the corpse to
when it is sewn...
...i must confess...
...this will make a mess...
...the stiff is ripe and putrefied...
...i scalpel the mephitic skin...
...and trace the letter ""y""...
...so the autopsy begins...
in order to field dress this cadaver we cut from the
bottom of the neck to above the crotch
some pathologists prefer to first puncture the bloated
corpse to release built-up methane gas
simply grasp the scalpel and apply downward pressure
at the jugular notch
you'll find the skin will slice like butter, revealing
subcutaneous tissue and ballooning yellow fat...
...no time to flinch...
...only amateurs cringe...
draw the blade down over the body of the sternum and
breastplate
past the manubrium and xiphoid process and
costoxiphoid ligament group
split the rectus abdominal muscle without a measure of
haste
then stop and wipe your brow and take a moment to
recoup...
peel back the flayed skin and shear it from the muscle
sides
taking the retractors, spread the carcass wide
costal cartilage snaps from each of the ribs so we may
look inside
the inner organs sit on display-glistening-with
nothing to hide...
...you've earned your degree...
...in the art of necropsy...
...the stiff is ripe and putrefied...
...i scalpel the mephitic skin...
...and trace the letter ""y""...
...so the autopsy begins..."

now trapped within the waves of fury
splintered our ship to pieces - fading screams are washed away
who will see another day?

the change of season's got a bittersweet sting
but i know that mother nature's got her own scheme
anyway i got no choice in the matter so i guess it's ok
rain, rain go away - and don't come back until i say
don't get me wrong, got no demands i'm not expecting another sunny day
rain, rain go away - and don't come back until i say
in my navet i'd sure appreciate if summer would stay
- summer would stay
bees and wasps, mosquitos and flies go with summertime
and for several reasons  don't get much sleep on summer nights
the change of season's got a bittersweet sting
but i know that mother nature's got her own scheme
anyway i got no choice in the matter so i guess it's ok
rain, rain go away - and don't come back until i say
don't get me wrong, got no demands i'm not expecting another sunny day
rain, rain go away - and don't come back until i say
in my navet i'd sure appreciate if summer would stay
- summer would stay
winter's starting to creep up on people - sun's retiring or so it's seeming
clothes with full coverage in the store windows
no more itsy-bitsy-teeny-weeny-hardly-cover-me-bikinis
rain, rain go away - and don't come back until i say
don't get me wrong, got no demands i'm not expecting another sunny day
rain, rain go away - and don't come back until i say
in my navet i'd sure appreciate if summer would stay
rain, rain go away - don't come back until i say
don't get me wrong, got no demands
i'm not expecting another sunny day
rain, rain go away - and don't come back until i say

summer would stay - summer would stay
summer would stay - summer would stay

your smile makes me smile
your anger leaves me dry
your praise makes me high
your approval makes me fly
your kiss keeps me warm
your indifference leaves me torn
when we fight i am worn
you confuse me - my mind's a snowstorm, oh
you have total control over me
you, you are the remote control - i'm the tv
you are in complete command of my mood
you, you know i mostly feel good, oh
your touch makes me glow
your glance equally so
your attention makes me grow
when you're gone time moves so slow
you, you have total control over me
you, you are the remote control - i'm the tv
you are in complete command of my mood
you, you know i mostly feel good, i feel good

resuscitate,2007,freya,"the scythe the hourglass
he hold us in his grasp
so i can't rush in haste
when i wait it changes everything
sometimes it all just falls apart
sometimes it turns to what i want
bend back the rusty bars
set the bridges ablaze
cinders drift in the air
to light the path below
refused to fall in line
will not be caged or chained
i know there's more for me
all the pain that i have suffered taught
me i was stronger than i thought
there's enough time to turn back the tide
resuscitate all the drums time killed
bring them back to life
to let them carry me over the broken ground
i will not be forced down
cast the cards that have been dealt away
the futures mine to make out of it
what i will i'll be the one to bring
my dreams to life
bring it back to life"

always seem to hold on when it's down to a flat line
just can't touch her heart
no matter how i try i am a ghost
all i wanted was for her to love me
for just a little bit

both bought new dresses, wore them right away
cut off the tags - no second thoughts
can't take them back, wouldn't want to of course
why be sensible - money's dispensable
don't worry be happy make the most of what's available
wear your sunday best on mondays
doubt when the weather report says: save it for a rainy day
we could see each other saturday
or get together next week, - but why wait? use the good china

we didn't write it but it's so cool that  i'll quote it anyway:
""you've got to love like you've never been hurt
act like you don't need money when you go to work""
-look before crossing - it's advisable
but jumping in with both feet is what i call admirable ...

cross the bridge of light into eternity
drink down the details
hold them in my heart

she is my salvation

journey-s-end,2007,black-majesty,"there is fire in my veins
to return to my home land
where the twilight dances
through the skies at night
hear the call
through my transient dreams of home wishing for a quick return
as i set out on my way
i'm on my way

roads that i walked are far behind
the things i've seen
the moment spent
to guide me on this journeys end
moving toward the blinding light
drowns my soul into unborn life
one day i'll find my way home
all the miles i've walked alone
silent company i've known
on the wings of the night
my spirit takes to flight
seeing signs of a day that's yet to come
never fearing the unknown
as the north wind fills the sails to my home


on my way i'm heading home
to a place i long forgot
but my memories have served me well
with a vision i have seen
golden roads and silver streams
but reality will cease to be
"
legacy,2007,black-majesty,"we're all waiting for a sign
show me a way which is divine
we're following paths where the blind leads the blind
if this world has fallen behind
do we blame it on mankind?
for all the sins we've left behind
when will we rise again?

on these sad wings we write this history
to leave behind our legacy
the future holds the key
that opens many doors
the choice is yours
choose carefully
there's a light that guides our way
close our eyes and we may say
we're only to blame if this world is in flames
persevere 'til we can achieve
a harmonious reality
with open eyes what will we see?
our rise again


if you follow the path that your visions have seen
they'll be blinding your eyes
and then stealing your dreams
don't confuse love with hate
you can follow the path
in which your heart believes you'll be sure to receive
all your dreams have foreseen

you were shedding in vain

would you bleed for the sign?
take them back to the sea where they belong

the sands of time lay dormant
they lay there - waiting for you
there are whispering voices
that are guiding your path
will you choose the one that you know that is right?
don't let confusion take over
now as time seems to falter
all your reasons will fade
is it worth giving your life
in finding the final prize?

should you bleed for the sign?
drive them back to the sea where they belong

see the sands of time they lay dormant
they've been waiting - for you to arrive
the sands of time they have been dormant they're waiting for you

you've been shown the right path to follow
now hide it well
don't let no one find the way
there's a light in the distance
gather strength so you'll reach it
now you run
run and find the final sign


find the sands of time
send him a sign
there are mystical secrets before you
will they arise, your visions divine?

you have bled for the sign
now throw them back to the sea where they belong

they have been dormant

walking away
can i leave it all behind
can i find comfort in the fact that i'm not sane?
look towards the future in a pessimistic way

beyond reality life in question
can there be more than we see
beyond reality dividing moments
testing our faith in what we believe

shifting through dimensions of another time and place

a cut that ceases to heal, a headache the no longer feels, a tear that drips slow, a boy without a home, strangers wearing kind stripes of gold
so let the rain fall slow, this delicate silence has finally found a home while the rave of the night follows morning
the lights, they sing, why dont you find all your troubles and put them to sleep with a kiss goodbye, goodnight
but i have tried too hard to fight for our love and then watch it fall apart
in front of my eyes, youll see
if you want it like i do, then pray here with me
just look to the stars and never forget how our stories untold were just stories unsaid
so lets sing to the sky, raise up our glass, while our times were well spent, our times were too fast
so just grasp my hand, throw it away, drop all of our promises and float into space

but now it's cold and i'm scared, i've started now to realize that you were just trying to save me when i should've been trying to save you too
so take this broken girl, that's more than a saint,
stronger than stone, and rid her of pain
show her a road home, because i can't find pavement

best part of me is the past part of me and you
and it's nights like tonight
when the stars shine brighter
and they spell your name
i think derogatorily because i
know it won't ever be the same forever is a cinder block on string,
a broken heart seems a necessity
but i'm tired of losing sleep
i'm still breathing, but please rest assured
i'm left with an ""x"" amount of feelings
of the nights never heard
when i was torn between the heart
on my sleeve, the stone cold dilemma
that kept me neck deep
on the long drive home when you said you were fine
and the songs so slow, to help you think over time
but baby we both know we'll never let this go
just keep your friends out of your ear
while i keep mine out of mind
a range of four days is a long and
unexpected holiday, one that you shouldn't take but if the outcome feels okay,
to turn the page, to walk away then i'll have no choice but to keep keeping sad, s
traight glances, when i'm out the door
i'll take my chances
with blank stares and sideways glances,
to keep it up would be to take it for granted
to be the one to try and keep us afloat,
but the part of me that wants it picks fights
with the part of me that won't

hither and thither through infinity

wherein all entity had consciousness,
without th' accustom'd outward shape of life.
of these swift circling currents was my soul,
free from the flesh, a true constituent part;
nor felt i less myself, for want of form.
then clear'd the mist, and o'er a star-strown scene
divine and measureless, i gaz'd in awe.
alone in space, i view'd a feeble fleck
of silvern light, marking the narrow ken
which mortals call the boundless universe.
borne on the wings of stark immensity,
a touch of rhythm celestial reach'd my soul;
thrilling me more with horror than with joy.

deep inside, in the world of empty words...
no escaping from those haunting
empty words...
do you ever feel it?
a craving that is so strong
to by thought rewind in order to find
expectations that shined through the doubt
that soon would turn into the price
of what a word will be worth

but i don't know me that well as you see

increase flames, the heat is oppressive
disturbs my brain, i want to dive in...
enter now so deep the flames,
i respect the silence
overcome with cold i pray
i see all the trees, the sky

space-time,2007,gojira,"i fix my attention on this ball
spinning round inside of me, deep inside
revolving conscious planet
on an axis around this star

and the black holes in the vault of heaven

how matter can disappear
are there doors in this wall to reach the light
from time and space
now i see those mounts of fear
feel the weight of nonsense killing simplicity
i can touch this wind of night
that erases our light and makes us paranoiac
but my legs are now so tired
climbing all alone, all space, and all the time
so i fix my attention now
on this perfect planet revolving around this star
and the sun, it seems so close
i can touch the heat of presence and i know...
i can see this monster light
that embraces those notions : space and time
the black holes in the sky, i ask the reasons why
light blackened? door opened?
swim back time, door giving entrance to
supernova as only light
meet the earth and all the stars
the entrance, the essence, supply us"

keep on burning, change

order me to face the wind
my structure's alive,
my body's on the way

before the walls
of fear and madness

and strike me down
to the ground again

i have lost my reason
and i've made my sense
from up there i will see
where i'm from
and where the force of love
will tell me now to go

forced to look to the sky
and wonder why
we cannot face the fact that
we're all scared now
of mysteries of life
there is a mask that soon will fall
before the strong embrace
of love and might
of light in the dark
i go for a quest
i have to give myself the answer
enter now this place in the wild
i can see the glade
my feeling now is growing bigger
from the sky
i do feel like no one can save me
i am so alone and yet i cried
i called for help, forsaken
but now i know
the only was is to
understand the living
obey the rule of light
and face the fear
inside out !
lost, i found there a stone
erected in line
with one the brightest stars
of all the night sky vault
and i took my time
took off the moss
washed away the dust
and gave a new lease of life
it's mystical force
i grab it now
and praise this lord
of earth and stone
make passage for souls awaken
so it returns
to where it's always been
with the gods
now coming, i feel the love
it comes from on high
i know the words
but now i feel it inside
it grows, it's there
and all it comes from the sky"

somewhere my new life will begin
countless treasures i shared with you
the only one left is my solitude"

contemplations-along-the-way,2007,crimson-moonlight,"i can see all there is to see
but i'm blind to my fate,
to what may come.
i think i'm awake
but stealing upon me
like the frost in the night
i neither see nor notice the moment when it comes
light is what i look for.
i want to be conscious,
aware of what happens now
and what happened then.
you feel like a bewildered entomologist
who now and then encounters true and original experiences,
but many times discovers that it has all been false.
who lays down the rules?
my knowledge points at the self,
so it isn't strange at all that you think you know
and mistrust your experiences at the same time
when later you get it in perspective and are able to investigate.
but i must put the question:
is this true?
to what degree are you and i affected by everything around?
to get a clear picture of yourself
you must of course have others
who can bandy back your ideas to you,
make contradictions and attack you from angles
you didn't know existed.
but i ask myself the question if there was none
with any other opinions than yours
would you say you could be awake then?
you wouldn't see the whole world
nor be aware of anything beside yourself,
but that would naturally seem the total reality.
this way of thought might veil over the truth
and make you blind.
you ask maybe where in the world you are and what you do,
but to discuss the question with yourself
might reveal which way you took and which you didn't choose.
best of all would be to find the keys to the treasury of wisdom,
but would that make life better...?
all your experiences of life tell you
that each man wherever he is has his own worries to fight.
the keys to the treasury of wisdom
will never be found, because it would mean
you would become totally enlighted, lonely
and independent of everybody.
so what would then be the meaning of life?
when life is the one and only thing we own
and once again the questions asked
create more questions still.
maybe all the answers will come
when we have left this earth and enter
what is there beoynd.
that will probably be experienced
as different as we are different from one another
and due to who and when it happens.
but the answer to the questions must be waiting for you there,
for if there are no answers
how is it possible that we should puzzle over them here?"

his arms around me

""you..."" the voice came, ""beloved one""

and walked before me
and i followed his footsteps
with a sound of deliverance
a small and hidden gate
was opened for me
""follow me"", he said
and invited me
into the landscape
from where i first came
we sat down by a fire
and while his eyes penetrated me
he started to show me
the purpose of all my pain
""you see"", he declared
""i myself once did this for you""
""for me"", i replied. ""why?""
he continued:
""i once walked this path of pain
but i went much deeper
than you ever may do
my love for you knew no end
and therefore i did
i had to sacrifice my life that time
and i did it
because of the never fading love i have for you
but, though your pain was terrible
and i saw no end to your sufferings
i have walked the whole path with you
you have not taken one single step
without me seeing it
and i have heard every one of your words
i heard when you cried for help
when you asked the father to see your pain
behold the path now lying behind you""
i turned and watch
the steps on the road
each one of them was covered with blood
as steps before also were
his smile told of his great love to me
and as i started to cry tears of relief
he made a statement
beloved one, i may not tell you why
i let you face situations like these
but i give you a promise...
i will never do these things
to hurt you in any way
but to strengthen you for future walk
and remember
beloved one you will never be able to walk
deeper into the unknown parts of the forest
than i have done
i have walked the whole way
and therefore i know how to give you guidance
when you feel trapped on unknown ways...
he suddenly stood up and pointed
in another direction, and said:
now walk this way and you will soon be
out on the main path again
he disappeared from my sight
but my spirit could feel his presence of his
i trusted his words, and soon i walked
beside the clear spring again
my whole being was strengthened
and i was armoured with the trust in him

take me back from beyond the horizon
for a little while
let me feel the idea of a sun dance
i will hold my head up high
just before leaving
like a raindrop in the sun
could i believe that i am one
was it a wonder or a present from above
how should know if i will ever laugh
but time is unyielding it's never standing still
to control the forces that are breaking down my will

just follow into the light

look behind the charading games they played
take those chains here away from me
don't pour some oil into the fire
shake off the past and you will agree
will-o'-the wisps they will be never leading me

don't dream of life just live your dream
and use the power of believing
i am eternal, into the light i ride

image the glory, the sound of the praises
when god and his riches, he lavishes treasures
and into his kingdom, he welcomes the beggar.

under an oak so old

the willows even though the day's turning dark very fast now
rivers full of dreams flow endlessly
may the stars will stay and will laugh at our smallness

into the woods, hear the silver firs' breathing
where the forests end, it's the banquet of bards
so, that's the magic - whirling clouds and fair
journey stories to find!
someone's announcing the event of a new day's birth
bards around a table sing ""all is fair in love and war!""
farewell, my friends, i leave
wisdom's all i learned so far, words of ages
heard the jester's voice, by the ruins he spoke
atrocious truths under the cloak of lunacy
learning from into the brushwood of k'horen
i lie and wait, chasing my dreams so far



in a forgotten place of earth, a noble quest it has begun
another banquet, another song, grace to you o forest deep
gathering of dwarves, elves and men
satchels and pouches they bring forth
the banquet of bards
now that we leave all the crickets stay silent
along our quest, we'll see the world spin
mystic places and yellowing leaves that won't fall
it's my own fate
into the woods, hear the banquet of bards
the treasure i found now i share with you"

and fading dream

to enter a world hidden far 
hushing the fears, i can see with blinded
eyes
nearby the circus this time i won't pass!
where all the fears and indifference lie
a warm place to drown
your own need to find
the questions that bury your mind
you won't find the answers to life

now turn your head, step back from the
jesters, run!
a quest that only some would take
it grabs our soul if there is one
could  be that we're left alone
or guided by the moonlight
runaway runaway runaway
from this midnight circus
on this ride on this tide
i am crawling deep inside
and fair wind's awaiting me

fallen away from the chains of my mind
it's my own choice to attain the truth
free from all wavering i hear a song
go far ahead, you will hear
a harmony carved into life
few final steps
dream on...

runaway runaway runaway
from this midnight circus
on this ride on this tide
i am crawling deep inside
and fair wind's awaiting me
runaway runaway runaway
and all the fear is gone now
on this path we take, this lifewe share
an answer might appear
and fair wind's awaiting me
a quest that only some would take
it grabs our soul if there is one
could  be that we're left alone
or guided by the moonlight
burning constellation
on this trail to the unknown
i just keep on questoning
for an answer never told
darker than the night
is the way we're passing through
courage and faith it takes
to make it last that far
it may ends for tomorrow
or it may take a lifetime

i gave to the vortex of reality,
gave it all away for all and for me-

i am of them but furthest come behind
yet may i, by no means, my wearied mind
draw from my thoughts, but as they flee
ashore, fainting i follow, i leave off
therefore, since in a net i seek to hold
the wind
the sweet season, that bud and bloom
forth brings
the summer has come, for every spray
now springs
with green had clad with hill and ehe

and the seas became giant mirrors
and trees formed a crystal splendour
the world is frozen to the core

through the corridors of snow and ice
through a gallery of reality
history unfolds before your eyes
there, between the exhibited bodies
framed by frozen blood
her skin scabrous, once so soft
that must be the one, the one i once loved"

mythical oaths, forgotten glories

whispering secrets
thoughts, they seem so common
to me they don't make any sense
where the essence was undone
revealed now like celestial winds
about my hope, my life, my agony and strife
the joy and faults, my feelings and thoughts
whispering secrets exclude that it's just fantasy
uncommitted to a language is talking without words to me
about my hope, my life my agony and strife
the joy and faults, my feelings and thoughts

like the call of a goose
even the invisible signs
are like water, crystal clear
whispering secrets"

this initiation enlarged my sight
i now found the witch in me
through the lucid eyes of witches you'll see
the things that man can't see anymore
the origin of life still lives in every tree
that in the witchcraft lies the source of all the lore
praise the seasons, praise the night
witches teach me how to see
this initiation enlarged my sight
i now found the witch in me
the salty lips, the fivefold kiss
on my whole body there's no spot they miss
these words, a vow of secrecy
a flagellation, forty times, sealing this
receive the atheme, its effects will make me rich
because the seeds of fertility i now sow
i stand the invocation of witch

whispered promises
of then, and years after
got broken, unmendedly
washed upon the beaches
of a file long gone
but i will go
i will find my lips with peace
i will hide every word
in my empty thoughts
i will go
with hope filled arms
i will look for signs
i will look for questions
asking me why i kneel to life
i will go
i will pray for saviour
and will welcome any ending"
along-ethereal-levels,2007,autumn,"tiredness and sleep we expound
as a natural urgency to redeem
from the flesh to dwell 'round

rise along ethereal paths, fly into the web
filled with symbols, representing your lot
see, hear, ethereal levels
touch, feel, ethereal levels
see, hear, ethereal levels
touch, feel, ethereal levels
while you move in a deep trance
stepping out of your earthly shell
filled with divinity so immense
you're visiting heaven, while you saw hell
reach the last chakra at the top of the tree
this divine feeling that seizes your soul
in a deep meditation it could happen to me
in a boundless light, you approach the goal

the touches, the kisses, the astral caress
i see the sky when the clouds move aside
i see the sky when the clouds move aside
i see the stars
blink in a green light that awakes in me
the witch queen this night
i made love to witches so divine
they let me forget the hurt
when i found the missing link
between death and rebirth
the power of an enormous might
struck down on holy ground
where i made it mine
trough making love

mirrors-magic-sight,2007,autumn,"and she's dreaming about
the view over the castle down below
there is no doubt
a curse came upon her
as she knows...
the voices of reapers
shading off into sounds of the night
becomes visible in a mirror
the mirror with its magic sights
the cause of the inner row
is the promise of horror and strife
if she keeps looking at the beauty below
despair will take over her life
her eyes , her deep blue eyes
she averts them from the casement
and she is weaving
while the loom obeys her hands
weaving...
lustful groaning by moonlight
a luscious mistress and her paramours
making love in the brewing night
till dawn they enjoy each other
while being a mirrors magic sight
and when someone dies
a threnody sounds from the towers
so she weaving in her web
also weaving a funeral
under sunbeam showers"
the-well,2006,autumn,"glazed and wired on this strangest day
choking on everything in me
scraping the tar from the garden walls

torrid waters emerge
an acrid feast of sparrows drowning
and in twilight hours
it hopes to dream of restful places
weeping as one
the rain is all we have
all we have
vultures fanning me
with their hungry shadows
they cannot hear the ticking inside my head
so they bury me just the same
deep the well
deeper still the weight of my descent
filling, surrounding me
i too, become
the well
i too"

linger at your lips
tasting your milk
it's my renewal
in times of isolation
i come to you
secret addiction
and in the daylight i wait eagerly
to visit you
again and again and again
for ever when i will stop

the-night-i-bore-the-maiden-s-child,2006,autumn,"it was to be the strangest night i'd ever know
it was the night i'd bear the maiden's child
and break the spell
and break the line
it would have kept me from my truth until the end of time
and then the maiden spoke to me
kissed my eyes, she let me breathe
and when her veils fell to the sea
she picked me up and carried me
to a place where lovers bleed
the blood of love, so tender sweet
now looking back to where i'd lain
i knew then i'd never rise again
she broke the spell and broke the line
that could have kept me from the truth until the end of time
though i've played among the fallen leaves
taken in the splendor of the seas
and mother moon still muses me
in her, i've found
my eternity"

in the light they shall retreat

must incite you to believe
tasting our scorn they turn away
from those ruins of our decay
but the sorrows they have seen
must incite you to believe
holding them so close to me
to cradle them in the softest breeze
amidst shadowed forest greens
now plowed away to starve their dreams
crawling now on wounded limbs
over colorless stone
and stained glass debris

sun-dried tendons slide away

whitest pallor of blackest lips

my whole body in a rage over
air-brushed battles we have waged
so terrified
so terrified
to divide and conquer the
running-drunken-splendor over
screaming blackest waters
and the blood we shed
in moondrop tears
to remember broken bottles
railroad ties so torn and mangled
that safer place - we had everything
inching closer, salt of your fingers
pressed against you, legs could not bear the weight of night, nor the stain of light
heavy scent of pain in the air
weeping for the stillness did not comfort us
it only frightened me
to divide and conquer the
running-drunken-splendor over
screaming blackest waters
and the blood we shared
in moondrop tears
now we lay the shallow grave
to the end of sunlit days
but we could have changed
everything
and forever i will carry your prayers to my lips
returning the warmth to its master
as you fade away
in moondrop tears
-oh god, i have always loved you. . ."

and to taste myself upon your willing lips
it would release me
with no regrets
and no remorse
the loss is imminent

these things are mine for now and always....always

with the hope that you may release me

this deadened consciousness

biting through
as ice storms wait to pierce the flesh
and i...and i...
a wild eyed child running faster than
the echo of her mother's loving voice
of her mother's loving voice...
closing over us all
opening the doors
opening the rooms to us
a prayer now to feel again
the warmth of memories
i call my home
so spellbound into this domain
of dreamlike waters' heavy groan
it is nothing more than that
than that which we have always known
so spellbound into this domain
of dreamlike waters' heavy groan
it is nothing more than that
which we...which we...
that six months is not long enough
to forget that everything erased will be written again
everything erased will be written again

and for now we know,
the waiting is until the end
the waiting is until the end
the waiting is until the end

but did you ever see him come?
even though his eyes are shining true
he's not the savior for me, nor for you

with one last option left
to destroy and recreate
we are the new generation
with purpose, conviction, and dedication
we are the new generation
with purpose, conviction, and dedication
counting past the final hour
in flame we've been reborn
a pure stronger power
a new oath we have sworn
these nights mean too much to just let them go
putting on the final touch
our true colors show
we are the new generation
with purpose, conviction, and dedication
we are the new generation
with purpose, conviction, and dedication
on the phoenix throne
death and rebirth
on the phoenix throne
death and rebirth
nothing as far as the eye can see
a straight, clear path moving
towards our destiny
and now we rise
we rise on the wings of flame
and now we rise
we rise on the wings of flame
nothing holding us back
as we rise on wings of flame
momentum pushing forward
as we rise on wings of flame

in some calm land beside the sea to die

but let the autumn lend
tongues to the leaves
no candles shine
nor tomb i need, instead
let them for me a bed
or twigs entwine
when brooklet ripples fall
with murmuring sound
and moon is found
among the pine trees tall
while softly rings
the wind it's trembling chime
and over me the lime
in blossem flings
as i will then no more a wanderer be
let them with fondness store my memory
and lucifer the while
above the pine, good comrade mine
will on me gently smile?
in mournful mood
the sea sing sad refrain...

the colour of our faded madness?

look like two candles glowing

i see you stand before me in a mist that does enfold
your eyes are full of tears, and your fingers long and cold
about my neck caressing your arms you gently ply
and it seems you want to speak to me, yet only sigh
and thus i clasp entranced my all, my world of grace
and both our lives are joined in that supreme embrace
oh, let the voice of memory remain forever dumb
forget the joy that was, but nevermore will come

paradise-beyond,2006,agathodaimon,"where the wind blows over the mountaintops into the ancient sky
and the flowers whither in the shadows of an autumn night
misty fog arises from the valleys and hides the face of the moon
underneath the ground lies a forgotten wisdom deep entombed
as long as ravens ride the nights
as long as the spirit of the earth takes seat between the spheres
the path beyond was locked behind the gates of consciousness - the mirror of the soul
time is passing by the mist, is creeping through the deserted land
and all the forests throw their leaves into the growing realm of sand
a whispered cry which told the tale of earth is hurt from above
it drowns the night into bright light and breeds a paradise beyond
and the wind unveils the hidden treasure from the soil
a sweet melancholy fills the plain with a lovely sound
unleashing the key to the gates of consciousness
take my hand i'll show you heaven
and walk the path beyond with me
together we will stand the night and flee from the void"

and an echo murmured back the word
merely this and nothing more!
fools and faith conspire
questions of desire
that they never owned before
kings without their armour
men without their honour
we all slip into oblivion
we are the dark inside the night
the ghosts about which the poets write
and the dreams that night's embrace
that slowly leave without a trace...

that it is alike absurd
or to lean against a shadow
or believe a woman's word

i feel that long ago the tale
was ended

howling in the wind, messing up my mind
i see i must close my eyes
climbing as if i was blind
holding tight to the rock
and i know i can't... stop
winds are blowing even stronger than before
but i don't feel i'm endangered anymore

it is hard to climb but now i know
i can do it if i want

will i ever see the top of the cliff ?
now the strength is abandoning me i am alone
cold is passing like a knife right through me
i will climb until i'm there, i will go to the peak

lo-shan-shen-long-pa,2007,drakkar,"
here on these mountains i have found my destiny
my training's over now, after many years
the wisdom of the ancients will be guiding me
the spirit and greatness will forever live

am i worthy for this legacy?
will i live up to it?

feel the power and the might
of the dragon of the east
rising from the waterfalls
evil ones you must beware
of the power of the shield
and the mighty dragon fist
the knight of libra taught me everything i need
not to betray his lesson, this is up to me
the mighty dragon's cloth now is mine by right
burns all the power of the stars i have inside!


instead of falling the water will rise
this is the power in me
forces of nature i know and command
as long as my heart is clean
i'll fight for justice all over the world
this is the promise i make
follow the dragon, follow the light
it is calling my name
"
dragonship,2007,drakkar,"
all around i hear the crackling of broken ice
vision is not clear because of fading light
frost in the air, but my heart is warm
something burning levitates, rising from the lake
by two great wings it will fly in the skies
dragonhead on the bow, with two shinin' eyes
""welcome on board"", i hear in my head
tho' nobody' speaking now, i can hear it loud

i feel the power growing inside of me
everywhere i want to go
drakkar does, drakkar knows

dragonship spreading the wings
bring me tonight, into the fight
dragonship riding the wind
the reign of death, we'll make it end
dragonship

i am the spirit of the last dragon
i live inside this ship
i've been waiting for centuries
for a pure of heart
my honour's to serve you
to do as you command
my fate is to help you
in a mission so hard
we've finally reached the castle now
dispel the magic, it won't keep me out
cold flames erupt, from the drakkar's jaws
and the shield is melted down, blue flames all around

"
under-the-armor,2007,drakkar,"see him shining red and gold, rocket boots to make him fly
to defend the innocents dedicates his life
evil ones all around, till he crush 'em to the ground
an avenger made of steel, he's the iron man

he's invincible
man-machine for war

under the armor you know there's a man
his greatest weapon his brain
fightin' with weapons he did by himself
no one can stand in his way
he can be invisible, he has got repulsor rays
honorable, strong and brave, technologic knight
without fear he always fights for the justice and the peace
armored and dangerous, he's the iron man


see him shining red and gold, once again he flies around
he's in search of criminals, nowhere they can hide
hearing his metallic voice, they will sweat and tremble with fear
knowing they cannot escape from the iron man

sentence to mediocrity,

forgotten, forsaken,
frustrated when nothing more remains

places to go where i'd never been,
visions so brutally ruined,
cause i didn't dare to try

people spend their life
regretting the things they never did
all those times they turned away
was yet another dream unfulfilled

how could i be so wrong?
how could i be so wrong?

are testament to the lack of of realism within the hearts
and minds of many activists fighting for social justice around the world
though the demonstrations were successful in that they did
postpone the wto conference and brought important issues
to the front pages of virtually every major newspaper for a full week
they offered only marginal success, as the wto still convened
and exists as it did long before the demonstrations sparked
discussion and then quickly faded with all the expectancy
if any other news story, though progress is indeed a process
we must remember that our steps towards justice are indeed only steps
and are only noteworthy in that they will lead us to the next step
in praising simple and limited achievements as great strides
we ultimately put ourselves at risk of being discouraged
to continue after learning that our greatest efforts
usually yield only marginal results"

i watch again, recapitulation, worn down

i wonder what has become of my life
the gaps in our lives seem to be so easily replenished
with the products of our imagination, allowing ourselves to believe
that the touched up digital images of perfection are real

it ascents higher and higher to an abyssal summit,
abrupt ravines where sink the grounded souls,
the spirits tortured by the fire, the blood, the desire,
the dishannonic and intoxicating music of the impious cries,
the chorus of a dark etemal church,
the love which dies in a nauseous rale,
vomiting her last sweetness in a melodic and proud crescendo,
led through the transparent and fantastic colours,
the priest hears his last prayer
under the broken vault of this stonework which vibrates into
what it is not and will soon no more be,
insufflating him its dying fluid
which curdles under the rhythm of the requiem.

with the eternal lamentations of the blind morpheus,
captive of an invisible dungeon from which he was formally the master.
the flutes measure of this grim hunt,
that no blood will soil,
a requiem of a dreamed dance.

and its essence will bear the sign forever,

pinned down without a crown

dead to faulty love and time
faulty time

death is just a feeling
you and i, swapping finitude and love for diamonds
value by value i'm gonna turn into breath after breath
love, we trade in for silver
defy what they used to call ""death""
and dust covered treasures will shine again
an unseen accolade
larger than life, a memory, death will be just a charade
dead and alive, come a little closer
you and i, affiliates forevermore and i'm alive
death is just a feeling
you and i, swapping finitude and love for diamonds

some they would call it a penance
why am i meant to face this alone
asking the question time and again
praying to god won't keep me alive
inside my head feel the fear start to rise...
they'll be saving their prayers when the moment comes
there'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
and the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
they'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

as the mountain tempted in a vision
where the angels spread their wings

and so the story began with me falling
into a dream where the forest were calling
closer and closer the twilight was dragging
me down to the unknown
so here i am all alone in the tree land
feeling the wind of my fate close at hand
creatures of the night begins to take form
i'm surrounded now

i don't know how it all began
i can't remembere anything
yesterday's forever gone
i am trapped in a place beyond time

and the moon is shining bright over the forest
and the creatures of the night won't let me rest
beyond reality - for no one to see
dark is the dream - no one hears my scream
i can't stand those staring eyes
eyes of the forest gloom
eyes of the forest gloom
predator eyes that watch me intensely,
their gaze from the shadows are burning me slowly
hunted i search for my way through the dreamscape
and it's feel so real
will i survive? i have to wake up,
but deep inside i know that i'm trapped
lost in a dream that's no longer a dream
my life is flashing by



silver moonbeams light my way with their glow
yet, gnarled trees rip my skin as i go
deeper down into the ominous gloom
i'm afraid this path is leading to my doom



and so the story ends with me dying"
the-power-behind-the-throne,2007,crystal-eyes,"

once there was a mighty king
whose tragedy bards still sing
he ruled his realm right and fair,
doing evil no one ever dared
then one day a stranger came
""randal,"" he said, ""is my name
the art of magics is my trade
and i'll entertain if i get paid""
and the king gladly took him in,
never seeing the wizard's grin
from that day the blissful years
forever changed into times of fear

day by day, the wizard was slowly taking control
day by day, the king was slowly losing his soul

and no one could see
the shadow, which fell
upon the old king
a sinister spell!
the cause of his pain
no one could tell
the wizard just laughed,
his plan worked so well!
as the wizard rose in might,
he turned the king from the light
the king became grim and cold
and did whatever randal told
the king began a terror reign,
taught his people feel pain
they never knew that he was prone
to the power behind the throne


the malice gleamed in the wizard's eyes
when he was feeding the king with lies

the perfect drug
midsummer icy dusk
still noises overwhelm
lifeless, lovelorn and numb
haunt spectres from cold past

would you tell me that it's gone
will you watch all over me
in those creeping hours' fall
like supernova flash
exploding daily star
an inscrutable force
she-wolf awakes
comforter and best friend
always there - no anger drawn
just some things that i yearn for

as quick as it stopped
to fast to recognize
to slow to forget
... and i saw your face
lacrimas!
fundaments of mourning
telling more than a single word
an expression
like a chapter of the book of know ledge
just one drop of tears
lets my heart nescience disappear
i see more than you want me to see
i see more than i wanted to see
lacrimas!
the book of truth
lacrimas!
an elysian fruit
a mirror to see your inner-face
reflections on your skin
building up a story
making me worry
i cannot restrain
situation turns
feelings change
life alters
just you, forever"

in the garden of my dream
so pale and delicate...
mist danced arround your arms

my angel
it's cold here so cold without you
and statues of stone they whisper my name
for love so tragis shall not be forgotten
trees calmly sleep and wind blows my tale
with wine and tears i taste my loneliness
and if i die will you miss me, will you shed a tear
or leave a trace on my nameless grave
and my words echoes like mourning for beloved ones
those who are gone forever
and never come back
they never come back

so hard to find the joy
in happiness of others
when all is said and done
it seems i have to leave
as everyday i walk
and watch that something dies
so pale the walls surround
each day i slowly drown

now the tempest is present
and i, i drown in sadness
in my winds of dream
the night of the thousand suns awakes
every sun, every ray, darker than black
thousands ideas of you thousands uncried tears
chained words
uncried tears leaving my eyes
endlessly deep ravines of sorrow
conquering my soul
delivering screams in the darkness
sounding out of the misty paradise
far away the mystical unkown
deafening release

thunder like growl

of me, has blown out. my room becomes darker and darker! never will i understand
why fish can't walk. perhaps it's because i coudn't become part of my life. the

stands still, even life does. the painting on the wall lives it's own life. as
the night seems to be everlasting, so do i. born from a new and unknown womb, it

forever gone...
left in this place, while a sunbeam through the window alters my face.
no chance in taking my pain.
the seeds of the weeping willow are being sown inside of me.
a timeless mourn... day and night.
outside the window, life is smiling at me.
it bids me out, wished it could ease the pain over... my lost life.
why? i'm gonna travel the tabor's back;
in hope to find my soul, above her head.

this, a forlorn quest.
tabor is a myth like others.
disillusioned i return homewards...
lonely as i am.
homewards the grass grows green, surrounded by flowers in bloom.
a consuming jaundice comes my way...
my heart is torn. at last, my spirit and i romance about the past.

for i have planted back the seeds of the weeping willow in the earth again.

await...
floundering oblivion, hundering the vanished
soil-

the answers from me?

i murdered myself a hundred times, you can see the lines

i thought of every way i could undo the crime
that we could make it how it used to be
no...why?
you cannot imagine how desperate i feel
this all seems so dream-like and unreal
time! what is time to someone in grief
i can't even shed tears, just this blank disbelief
perhaps i cried once a century ago
here i stand shadowed by trees and the midnight moon
committing this sad tale onto paper
and to tell you, please think of me!
who created this pain i suffer inside?
who condemned me...
to this immortality!!?
reborn with no name
it can never be the same
no more peace for me
i give myself to eternity..."

still it felt so familiar and full of trust
so we accepted it like it was meant to be all along

feelings of things once lost
it can't be described in words
and yet we understand every single part
the solace in this feeling draws us closer
holds us together forever
no remorse
no feelings of regret
it's just the feeling we have inside forever to be ours again
the solace in this feeling never lasts
drives apart from each other
the solace never lasts but it still feels like home"
carnal-epitaph,2007,exhumed,"i scrawled an ode to this mortal coil
in scarlet upon your back
i gnarled in code with dreadful toil
a parting verse so black...
ivory skin streched out before me
in frozen fields of pallid grace
livid eyes rolled back and silently implored me
from out of your jaundiced face
carving in crimson with scalpel and rasp
sculpturing your flesh into your epitaph
your corpse tells its tale in blood, pus and grume
spilling out secrets you should take to your tomb
a carnal epitaph perhaps best left unheard
the time has come to mince more than words
parting words don`t often cut this deep
engraved on your back, the secrets we`ll keep
though you`ll never read these empty words
upon the slab you lie so still
they don`t cut as deep as you deserve
poetic licence to hack, maim, and kill...
the porcelain flesh that enshrouds you remains
were both my parchment and my muse
now incarnadined hand i penned these lines
as best i could well manage
i cruelly carved out these designs
what words are worth in tissue damage...

from ages in the void
desperation

there's peace in the slaughtered flesh
there's life in the frozen seeds
i'll dream in the deserts
and comfort the thirst for seeing
the violet dawn in the distance
beckons me to steal its light

pulsating underneath your skin

with bricks from secret cities
entering linear orbit
crushing the foundations of divided times
suns reflected

too much is too little in knowledge
driven mystery

drops of rain which have just fallen down
like the pearls on conweb's cover
i ask who we are
the candle lights
waiting for unquiet wind
a crooled mirror of space
a handful of ash which wants to
become the diamond

he is laughing at us
setting its face against us
we are not able
to rule over the current of his stream
in my mind's eyes i see the trees
which are trying to touch the sky
with their whispering arms
old tales are being told by the bird
just opening the arms is enough
to be soared up by the wind

setting its face against us

the separation came
like the prophecy
of my coming end
acute sharps of the rocks
which wound my feet
the roots of fear
have grown into my skin
sometimes i stop to hide
underneath the linen of his arms
after that, on sleepless night
i sing sweet lullaby
for my lonliness
i will come back there someday
and the rustle me with its prayer
mother earth will cover me
the nature will destroy the body structures
as lightly as she had built them before
the act of destruction
will redeem the miracle of birth
we will rise from dead"

i have come from the freezing seas
from the warmth of foreign coals
through the dismal fog of insecurities
to a cloud-enshrouded noble goal
the world has cast me from its laughter
thrown to the wolves, to the dread thereafter
so now i forge a journey fraught
through these bitter wastes of snow
over ice and gorge to an eden sought
far from the human races afterglow
this sightless climb is treacherous to weather
as the cold bites deep, old heartstrings sever
behind the jagged mountains
beyond the frozen north
at the back of boreas. the zealous wind
there crest celestial fountains
crystal waters soaring forth
in the realm of our sacred angelus kin
neither muse nor music flees
this garden of delights
everywhere the soothing hands of nature please
in this state of pure euphoria
paradise lies at the heart of darkness
and one must pay for this deep catharsis
now the storm-clouds retch
a vision fleets before my eyes
wherein minarets and spires touch
phantasmagoric skies
and meadows stretch to woodlands
of sweet nymph and fireflies
death is in the breeze
and his mind will paralyse
my mind is in the clutch
of something too long fantasised
behind the jagged mountains
beyond the frozen peaks
at the back of boreas, the zealous wind
the gods of love are counting
down the nights until we meet
in the realm of oursacred angelus kin
now the mirage blears
and the howling gusts renew their fury
the gleam of moonlit towers
fades to utter fear
the mountains rear in anger
at the righteousness i lack
and in their monstrous grasp i know
dear god
they will never let me back...
free of enemies, no death, disease
the doves of peace, in flight
carouse upon the ever-summer breeze
in this land of hyperborea
behind the jagged mountains
beyond their icy stares
at the back of boreas, the zealous wind
my soul is now surmounting
past the grasp of last despairs
to the realm of our sacred angelus kin
behind the jagged mountains
beyond the frozen north"

gaping at me with soothing darkness

friezes on the walls where grotesque granite creatures revel. stone reptiles strangling stone gryphons. stone maggots consuming the struggling monsters.

inside rooms without walls. columns without ceilings to support. the capitals shedding dead acanthus leaves which descend in slow
motion to become parts of the rustling on the floor.
doors leading nowhere. stairs spiralling into open air. formerly secret passages now exposed, leading deeper into the woods.
in one of the rooms a pile of tiny bones and a pointed hat atop of a tiny skull staring into the corner.

started to change me
i know you saw me
cause time just froze us
right there before the lights
we had a blast but time was not on our side

it will never satisfy
there's not enough time for our love

sometimes we're far apart
but here our future starts
away from you is hurting my soul
i'm bleeding stars

what happened right there between us was pure
my world and struggles all was made for you
no matter how much we will be together for eternity
all we need is to be patient
what happened right there between us was pure
my world and struggles all was made for you
so lets climb the top together
no thing nor time can hold us back for long
let all your heart just go into the deep bliss of the truth

will leave this mortal coil of flesh and earthly life, to fly into the
mist of night, into the nightside eclipse, and experience existence on
the other side. as a stone of scorching enthusiasm i refract the
reflecting surface of this unfathomable sea. growing circles of grief
and pain slides across the land as an omen of the horror yet to come.

and like mist they will come

and the despair comes complete
so lucidly we drown in sedation

a bruising reverence to the concrete
feel the frequency vanish
shedding suits, setting the actors free
far away, feeling so lucid
peeled the thin veil of lies
but soon arms fell down
the task, overwhelming utopia

here comes don quixote
charging windmills on and on
rise and restart! hope to overcome...
how meagre arms could have shovelled mountains?
how could meagre arms break all their chains?
pacified  with games

they groan under the yolk of bondage
until life itself becomes a burden!
restless hearts pumping ire... each one in his corner!
passed down as pride, an inescapable animal duty

crumbles another kingdom
engulfed where skies and sea collide
hear the whistles turning to howls
quicken your pace northward
as sea devours land
billions swept away, envied by the living
in global mourning, suffering the unison
they cry at azure darkening day by day
wilting breed of legends
forsaken breed, giants have fallen
hitting stones together again
vain calls for a lost light
gathered for the holocaust
they give lives away
for gods to embody again
then from the abyss ascended
this now happens to you again
under many disguises
the wombs yield offerings
as they did, as they will
slavery will never cease

leave a few of them to restart, first redeem beauty disfigured
for all warnings went unheard we meant to absterge

leaves have fallen, elements dispersed
the death of cells in the flesh of time
universes keep on revolving
a tiny voice in the celestial choir
brought dissonance and got forever silenced...

the sorcery of shamans old
to ever hunt the lords of cold
we drift within the sands of wrath
the wielders of the fire's path
an ancient magic
elderbound, bloodbound, earthbound
severed from death
we march, we march
bound to the throne
we march, we march
cursed by tellann
we march, we march
warriors of bone
we march
we cry to the blood-red sun in a voice born of stone and dust
spell of sorrow
spell of might
breath of fire
endless ice

echoes-of-battle,2014,caladan-brood,"there is a deep pathos here
a monumental sorrow
blood has stained this ground
the very land itself a barrow
the echoes of battle ring cold through the ages
the moon shines on old dunes, awakening ancient hatreds
swords held high to the desert sky at such great a cost
standards fly above funeral pyres
victory and loss
we are strong, but when the day is done we are left bereaved
marching on to the battle drum
triumph and defeat
behold the storming flood of iron
destruction wrought there upon the field
a host of warriors fall, never to return
their epitaph a song of steel
empires built upon the bones of those who stood beside us
the sun has set eternally into the dark
and we have seen the fields of war steal the lives of sons and brothers
the iron heart of glory beats a hollow dirge
the gods of battle rise and fall but the thirst for blood lives on
the wolves of winter rise and howl for honour's debt
the sands forever greedily consume the blood of friends and fathers
the gates of hood will open wide with dreams of death
there is a deep pathos here
a monumental sorrow
blood has stained this ground
the very land itself a barrow"
city-of-azure-fire,2014,caladan-brood,"the pale blue fire of glittering spires ablaze
the sojourner's beacon, a wondrous shimmering place
through ages forgotten, in many a traveler's dream
through winding cobblestone pathways
where dwell demons, mages and thieves
in temples and taverns where secrets are whispered
arcane knowlage hides in their halls
shadows gather in midnight processions
as wraiths and ghosts sing laments in the walls
written in blood and sealed in death
bound by the ages, the tome of regret
fates will be sealed and swords will be met
with the cold embrace of steel and flesh
eldritch beasts converge on the streets
of this ancient city, so beautiful and wild
veils of night, the tolling of bells
funeral march to the sound of the knell
the pale blue fire of glittering spires ablaze
the sojourner's beacon, a wondrous shimmering place"

i've been waiting so long,
to see the moon rising by your side,
how many days, since you're gone
i've cried so many times,
but i've spent so many hours to hide,
the tears i had in my mind

when will i see you again,
give me a last chance to make
love, with you forever and ever again,
i miss you,

i can't feel pain anymore,
i'm just lost in a world of sorrow,
but i will wait the hour
to set your heart on fire

mountains of ice i will cross
fountains of gold i will find,
to give you some presents,
as precious as you
in endlessly i will shout,
your name in the silence of night,
to exorcise my thoughts, as a prayer

when will i see you again,
give me a last chance to make
love, with you forever and ever again,
i love you,

is there any known feeling, on this mourning land?
cold winds whipping my back,

my dreams are fading away
winters light is failing away,
i am the star charmer, the spell keeper,
bound to me, all the chains to reverie
open, the main door if you find the key,
but remember, your memories belongs to history
progenies of night and moonlight,
dancing towards me
a dark black and hazy waltz,
with a frightening melody,
the road is long and sad,
i'm alone out in the cold,
thought i was going mad,
maybe i'm simply getting old

and i know that reality really won't mind
a benevolent soul, who desires to leave all their cares behind
later in the evening
i can hear all the vices calling to me
so i take another
little taste, to liberate my mind
from the finest kind
yeah the night's beginning
and the sea of bodies crowd around me
ready to remember
all the greatest moments lived in their lifetime
for another night

i'm a leviathan, focused on fulfilling a need

a feeding frenzy when the starving just forget where they are
you're in denial when you say you never wanted a taste
and you don't really want to let this stimulant go to waste
so don't deny it go on and try it
i'm looking forward to the moment when your mind will fall in love with the haze

taken possession of souls and lost spirits
the evil task is fulfilled, needless to prolong the stay
satisfied, the return has begun
to the valleys, the foretold shelter of evil
assigned by the inexplicable symptoms
roaming through the vast darkness
searching, groping after the hidden passage
despairing yet resolute
longing for established order
to reign and flourish at own environs

guided by the commission of evil

slipping through the allied maze

with the home flee on her tail

she sank the hood and the prince of waves
steaming on with dignity
continuing her mission
enjoying every victory
reloading the cannons

and its trees reflected solens golden light,

to welcome him and take away his fears...

with their retinue of countless men,
and the maiden in full armour sat on their horses,
winged, until the right began...

to the sound of a voice that was almost a scream
from out of the city and out of the street
out where the wind hits the cold concrete
it's cold outside
darkness your enemy
no place to hide
the voice said this to me
in your doorways i have shivered
in your alleys i have gone to ground
but i will be delivered
someday i will be mercy bound
i dreamed again it was west la
on a crowded street on a hot summer day
she was alone
three months late and beginning to show
in a midriff blouse she would soon outgrow
she had no one to call and no way home
and in my mind i knew i'd seen myself
but in our blindness it always seems like someone else
there i was a rag a bone
a remnant in your lost and found
i was for once truly alone
longing to be mercy bound
and i knew that i would wander
as a child in the forest till they found me
and i called out to them but could not penetrate
the silence all around me
and when i wake i know you'll comfort me
and i won't sleep again for an eternity
but others lie awake at night
in desperation more profound
and the coming of the morning light
will not see them mercy bound
and some will never dream again
from sleeping on the ground
longing to belong
and dying to be mercy bound
oh please don't stop your dreaming
someday we'll all be mercy bound"
leaving-the-spirit-behind,2007,anata,"did you ever feel it's like you're hanging over an abyss?
your hands are tied, you can't break loose
you're still hanging only because your teeth
have grasped the outermost twig of life
the only that keeps you from falling
is that you keep your teeth clenched
your body can struggle but you just can't scream
you know you'd be crushed hitting the floor of reality
you suffer on and feel soon you're about to give in
do you assume a reality existing without our perception
i don't believe it is so
the notion of reality is just a conception
created by senses and mind leaving the spirits behind
if you view reality
as existing without the persistence of minds
then keeping teeth clenched may be what is right
but if reality is created by you
realize this image can also be modified
i'm speaking of bringing the ground closer to your feet
reducing the distance between you and reality perceived
let go and land in this image of your consciousness
ready to reconstruct
do you assume a reality existing without our perception

clouded skies are reflecting his state of mind
storm rages above him in the dead of night
but also in his heart, his strength and will have failed him
and he's beginning to doubt
those were even features of a higher might
inside he feels emptiness
might reflect a void in heaven and the absence of god
devoid of content is the word of god
serves no purpose in conformity with his life
as all prosperity has been washed away
and no support is to be accounted for
from the good souls
he feels named and alone
as there's no one to answer his prayers
no angels, no intervention divine
would save him should he fall
all hope is lost but now, he dares not believe
or live in the lie that used to be his shield
if the meaning of life, to honor and live for god
proves to be a lie, what's there to live for?
i deny that there ever was a god
or a meaning of life other than reproduction
the rest is up to each and everyone of us
to seek or create
scourge of the philosopher
can there be a god if this world is a failure?
the problem is old but yet to be solved
so, if there ever was a god
he's either dead, powerless or a sadist

he's unworthy of our worship"

prepare your senses

last moments - last visions distort the true meaning
you live in fear - live on illusions
the question on guilt lies in your hands
last chances taken
the wheels of time turn back
great times - good things join with the fate of your torture
where are you now - where are you?
i can feel you, but i can't see you
your voice screams like the rain from the sky
my skin burns hotter than fire
i call your name - heaven fall silent
my heart is leaden with your thoughts
you live on under my skin
you live on the thoughts of my time
rest in peace - redemption is far away"

was swirling across the glitters of light.

a distant glitter amidst the woods
the sudden ungreening of the trees
unvailed a singing maiden's outstanding line.
""step forward to the shimmering one!
be kind to me my blistered feet!
obey! my swollen tongue for once
in my life i have to - to...""
but not i moved for all my might
the maiden smiled and walked on by.

i just had time to write a note
and all it said was ""i believe in you.""
passing conversations where they mentioned your existence
and the fact that you had been replaced by your assistants.
the discussion was theology,
and when they smiled and turned to me
all that i could say was ""i believe in you.""
i visited your house again on christmas or thanksgiving

the strength i need is now flowing away
the choking feeling obstructs everything
so erratic in search for the truth
the pain is strong and persists
silence was just a diversion to come out on the hard truth again
leaving this world of illusions seen through the eyes of the innocent

baby through the walls would stand
there was enough of cracks to let the rain come in
maybe that's why i never held your hand
because it all began where it all begins
you know it was a hard thing to do to forget when i always would see you
it's funny how we always seem to end up hurting someone when our day is through
you're speeding too fast for me now
you're leaving you were always lost somehow
it's like we always seemed to bet on different horses
arriving as the other one would leave
it's as it our fired fed from different sources

by womb of soil, the moist of dew
born when sun was high, the day was new
and the raven soared high up in clear sky
the land will speak to you, when your heart is pure
and you were made by
mother earth, father thunder
this heart winged, i am eagles son
through storm and syite, untouched, it is pounding on
this sword, forged in fire and ice
the runes that trail its blade can be seen but by my two eyes
as if written in the snow, the lies, shall melt away
by the wheel of sun to cross the sky this day

i am a man so high on this feeling i feel like dancing in the streets
i'd hoped you somehow would have always known
though i know i would let it show
i can't believe this is really happening
please someone punch me and ask me what day we have today
what day we're having today
i'm sure that i would not reply coz i would not if i was dreaming
still this feels good to be a lie
coz when i look deep into your big brown eyes
it's like a flash outta clear blue sky
and then that gentle smile when your eyes meet mine
it's like i loose all sense of time
oh, how i wished for all these years, how i've longed
how out of place all words will seem at times
it's like we don't need to talk at all
i get off quite allright from just looking into your eyes
from looking into your eyes from just looking into your eyes
it feels like i could surely fly
it happens every time you're near me
this feels so good it must be right
coz when i look deep...
oh, how i've wished...
i can't believe i've wished i'd died
that was before that you had called me

ain't this life and place just great
no wonder we just won't get 'nuff time
but though we know we can't stay
the world will still turn i wish you all the best
no need to return leave the past to rest
you just have to earn it's not to get but to give
and there's one thing i've learned
you just got to live to see the sun go down on everyone
you just got to live to see that gentle smile and feel alive
you just got to live to see the moon arise and the stars in the sky
you just got to live to take the pain sometimes and to leave it all behind

the unseen is watching from behind each stone and pine
slowly the golden dise of the sun is setting
beyond the rim of nordland at the end of long day
slowly the ominous dark descend upon all
engulfing all land and heaven and the shore of asa bay
here lie the bones of our fathers long gone
deep in the soil of these woods
among these great trunks legends were born
here many great battles stood
trotting the trail, my stallion cautions
present the spirits of foreverdark woods
we rest by the fire, the shadows come to life by its light
three brothers, sons of white wolf, observed by the eyes of the night
night is long where the sunlight is pale
the fear is strong when you ride in the dawn
down foreverdark woods trail
heavy the turf, bone meal and blood
raise high you pine towards sky
firm in the soil, tree trunks of gods
like dragon ship masts straight and high
reaching the glade, ride on to asa bay
watched by the spirits of foreverdark woods"

the endless sky and open sea
i will sail where the raven will lead me
fly on black wings, high and free
i shall return with the wind the day
from high adventures, swelling sail
autumn red comes to asa bay
meet me by the well where the water, crystal clear, flows free
from deep within the great mountain towering to the sky
i will be awaiting you coming down treading the trails of clues
bare feet, let your hair down like the mist across the pond
in dawn of time, before gods and man
when earth and shy was first divided
a star did fall into river deep
a star of gold into silvery water

in two hours you'll get out of bed

spreading their wings to fly to the hall up high
messengers of the all fathers

oh how i wish that i could sleep
i try but won't just sink that deep
my fingers won't stop aching so tired yet awaken
or should i let it all loose and just weep
i've been pacing up and down my floors i have lost all sense of time
i sometimes halt and ask myself if i'm about to loose my mind

ahiling a black sun with ebon rays,
hailing a black moon as onyx agleam,
the dark horn sounds 'cross the nighted vale,
shadows call in this bleak winter's dream.
i seize the throne round dagon's stone,
dark hordes arise 'neath winter skies,
forged 'neath the moon, by skulthur's tomb,
blood-oath sealed, by frost-veiled steel.
white flames dancing on the snow,
the witch-fire gleams through northern skies,
the frost of heather upon her tongue,
whispering dreams of atlantean spires,
ruby lipped, midnight tressed, eyes as black as raven's wing,
flesh so pale as dawn-frost gleaming,
kisses sweet like moon-dew's tears.
deep within the glacial ice-veiled temple,
ancient enchantments
summon the shades of the dreaming serpent kings...
and the ophidian throne once again draws
power from the moon-shrouded crystal...
mystic steel is anointed by the crimson wine of battle,
and blood reddens the gleaming snow.
storm-borne bride of winter's fire,
serpent-witch of the whispering fens,
veils of scarlet and sable,
blood spilled in the vault of night,
frost-garlanded, the mind-binding glimmer
of tear-filled ophidian eyes,
the gleam of winter moonlight upon black waters,
nighted spells of the enchantress.

immortal lord of darkmere, serpent-witch ensorcle me.

and rules both the dark and light

of the forest call my name
i saw the hammer way up high
'cause lightning in the rain
watching crystal flakes
of falling snow on winter nights
uniting with the pure white flames dance

a glimpse, our unity
our fate, harsh and dire

there i still meet thee
our sole place to meet
alas only grief
our patriarchs disagree
our young hearts in grief
down by the well
i shall meet thee

in your pulsing deep blue lake
the upper light seems to come from inside
liquid tension pulls me into the air
like unborn through the amniotic fluid
i'd remain in its womb
the light calls me to his reign
i'm born again
how hard is this night to see
my life breaking to free
a new light from tomorrow
beneath the past a sun is shining pale
with my hands i raise it into the air
found the dust in my eyes
submerge in a water now warm
merged into the first reflection
close upon me
this night lulled by waves
light breath of a liquid called life
quencing my thirst
i still dream"

i have only you
in my great surrender

and weary, he can't bear to face her. passing a backstreet bar, he's
easily enticed inside, while a stranger sensing his vulnerabilty, helps to
alleviate him from the responsibilty for the couple's last savings. dumped
in a drunken heap, and the stranger nowhere to be found, the father
struggles to his feet, as the alcohol suppresses his will to fight.
momentarily he sees a way out. a vantage point high on an empty bridge,

and she spills a silver tear for us
for our long dead heaven

only the vacant eyes of sorrow follow our steps
we're just empty shades of an empty life

cosmic-empire,2007,even-song,"a frozen galaxy drifted
in nature's amniotic seas
a universe of starry majesty
in the vast ocean of space
black planets rolled
without lustre and aim
in the yawning dark void
it was the dawn of times
the dawn of genesis
the age of mystery
motionless stars
without name and knowledge

and the great omnipotent slumbered
on the verge of the deep

a slumbering galaxy
a cosmic empire

eclipsing the stars, usurping heavens

we forgot eden, the garden of joy
our eternal life like a dream dissolved"

unrevealed by the scyhted moon's light
phantoms of times remote gather
beneath the bizzare, livid sky
behold this darkling realm
filled with mysteries of aeons bygone
step inside the darkness that lays bare the secret spheres
of the dream-woven sisterworld
beyond these phantasm-guarded gates
where gyving time and space are not
awaits a world ulterior, a realm unexplored
large as infinity

and new shadows appear upon the lone, phantasmagoric sky

to stop us now
all energy set free
we give ourselves up to madness
spitting fire all around
and thunder is pumping in your veins

through the dark of the night
with shivering hands and a feeling
of dread
a shout goes out they've seen the light
tower's proud light is yet in sight
tower high on the cliffs
your light it means survival
forgotten tower high on the cliffs
standing through the ages
in every one of us there is a burning light
a light of hope, a light of salvation
a light to lead us through this world of cruelty
a fight that lets us forgive, cry and laugh
but is it the light of life
or the light of death?"
