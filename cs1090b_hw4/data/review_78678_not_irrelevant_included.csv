"Cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions and associated cervical infections in an HIV-positive population in Rural Mpumalanga, South Africa.",Swanepoel PJ.; Michelow P.; Du Plessis R.; Proudfoot IG.; Tarr GA.; Bockel SL.; Swanepoel CJ.,"The incidences of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, associated squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical squamous cell carcinoma are significantly increased in HIV-positive women. The role of other cervicovaginal infections in the acquisition of the HPV infection, cervical carcinogenesis and genital HIV infection remains largely speculative. A retrospective study was conducted including 1087 HIV-positive women in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, for the period 1 May 2009 to 31 August 2010. For each patient, the age at first presentation, cervical cytological diagnosis, subsequent follow-up cytology and histology, and microscopically visible infections (including endemic Bilharzia) were tabulated and statistically analysed. The prevalence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), squamous cell carcinoma, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) in the study population were 22.1%, 30.9%, 0.6%, 13.5% and 4.0%, respectively. LSIL, HSIL and squamous cell carcinoma were diagnosed, respectively, at the average ages of 35.7, 37.9 and 37.2 years. Four patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), 32 with CIN2/CIN3 and two with cervical squamous cell carcinoma were also diagnosed with Bilharzia. Of the other infections only bacterial vaginosis had a positive statistical correlation with HPV-induced cervical abnormalities (LSIL, HSIL or squamous cell carcinoma). This study confirms the high prevalence of progressive HPV-associated cervical disease in a rural Southern African HIV-positive population, which is at least equal to or worse than in other African HIV-positive studies. The high incidence of Bilharzia infection in those cases that underwent cervical cone excision suggests a possible relationship with progressive HPV disease and cervical carcinogenesis. Bacterial vaginosis (perhaps in combination with Bilharzia) may compromise the normal barriers against HPV and HIV infection.",2013,Aug,Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology,24,4,264-71,,10.1111/j.1365-2303.2012.00998.x,22817687,#1305,Swanepoel 2013,"",""

BV was significantly associated with HIV infection with an OR of 2.84 (95% CI 1.08 to 7.46 and p value=0.034). However, BV was inversely associated with gestational age with an OR of 0.08 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.42 and p value=0.003) for second trimester pregnancies and an OR of 0.03 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.17 and p value<0.001) for third trimester pregnancies using the first trimester as reference. IVF was significantly associated with HIV infection with an OR of 2.7 (95% CI 1.07 to 6.79 and p value=0.035) but not with age or gestational age. Genital mycoplasmas were not significantly associated with age, gestational age, HIV status, BV flora or IVF.

Prevalence and correlates of bacterial vaginosis in different sub-populations of women in sub-Saharan Africa: a cross-sectional study.,Jespers V.; Crucitti T.; Menten J.; Verhelst R.; Mwaura M.; Mandaliya K.; Ndayisaba GF.; Delany-Moretlwe S.; Verstraelen H.; Hardy L.; Buvé A.; van de Wijgert J.;  .,"Clinical development of vaginally applied products aimed at reducing the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, has highlighted the need for a better characterisation of the vaginal environment. We set out to characterise the vaginal environment in women in different settings in sub-Saharan Africa. A longitudinal study was conducted in Kenya, Rwanda and South-Africa. Women were recruited into pre-defined study groups including adult, non-pregnant, HIV-negative women; pregnant women; adolescent girls; HIV-negative women engaging in vaginal practices; female sex workers; and HIV-positive women. Consenting women were interviewed and underwent a pelvic exam. Samples of vaginal fluid and a blood sample were taken and tested for bacterial vaginosis (BV), HIV and other reproductive tract infections (RTIs). This paper presents the cross-sectional analyses of BV Nugent scores and RTI prevalence and correlates at the screening and the enrolment visit. At the screening visit 38% of women had BV defined as a Nugent score of 7-10, and 64% had more than one RTI (N. gonorrhoea, C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis, syphilis) and/or Candida. At screening the likelihood of BV was lower in women using progestin-only contraception and higher in women with more than one RTI. At enrolment, BV scores were significantly associated with the presence of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the vaginal fluid and with being a self-acknowledged sex worker. Further, sex workers were more likely to have incident BV by Nugent score at enrolment. Our study confirmed some of the correlates of BV that have been previously reported but the most salient finding was the association between BV and the presence of PSA in the vaginal fluid which is suggestive of recent unprotected sexual intercourse.",2014,,PloS one,9,10,e109670,,10.1371/journal.pone.0109670,25289640,#1878,Jespers 2014,"",""

"Empowering HIV-infected women in low-resource settings: A pilot study evaluating a patient-centered HIV prevention strategy for reproduction in Kisumu, Kenya.",Mmeje O.; Njoroge B.; Wekesa P.; Murage A.; Ondondo RO.; van der Poel S.; Guzé MA.; Shade SB.; Bukusi EA.; Cohan D.; Cohen CR.,"Female positive/male negative HIV-serodiscordant couples express a desire for children and may engage in condomless sex to become pregnant. Current guidelines recommend antiretroviral treatment in HIV-serodiscordant couples, yet HIV RNA viral suppression may not be routinely assessed or guaranteed and pre-exposure prophylaxis may not be readily available. Therefore, options for becoming pregnant while limiting HIV transmission should be offered and accessible to HIV-affected couples desiring children. A prospective pilot study of female positive/male negative HIV-serodiscordant couples desiring children was conducted to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of timed vaginal insemination. Eligible women were 18-34 years with regular menses. Prior to timed vaginal insemination, couples were observed for two months, and tested and treated for sexually transmitted infections. Timed vaginal insemination was performed for up to six menstrual cycles. A fertility evaluation and HIV RNA viral load assessment was offered to couples who did not become pregnant. Forty female positive/male negative HIV-serodiscordant couples were enrolled; 17 (42.5%) exited prior to timed vaginal insemination. Twenty-three couples (57.5%) were introduced to timed vaginal insemination; eight (34.8%) achieved pregnancy, and six live births resulted without a case of HIV transmission. Seven couples completed a fertility evaluation. Four women had no demonstrable tubal patency bilaterally; one male partner had decreased sperm motility. Five women had unilateral/bilateral tubal patency; and seven women had an HIV RNA viral load (≥ 400 copies/mL). Timed vaginal insemination is an acceptable, feasible, and effective method for attempting pregnancy. Given the desire for children and inadequate viral suppression, interventions to support safely becoming pregnant should be integrated into HIV prevention programs.",2019,,PloS one,14,3,e0212656,,10.1371/journal.pone.0212656,30840672,#1919,Mmeje 2019,"",""
Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among pregnant women with known HIV status in northern Tanzania.,Msuya SE.; Uriyo J.; Hussain A.; Mbizvo EM.; Jeansson S.; Sam NE.; Stray-Pedersen B.,"To determine the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other reproductive tract infections (RTIs) among pregnant women in Moshi, Tanzania and to compare the occurrence of STIs/RTIs among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and uninfected women. Pregnant women in their 3rd trimester (N = 2654) were recruited from two primary health care clinics between June 2002 and March 2004. They were interviewed, examined and genital and blood samples were collected for diagnosis of STIs/RTIs and HIV. The prevalence of HIV, active syphilis and herpes simplex virus - type 2 (HSV-2) were 6.9%, 0.9% and 33.6%, respectively, while 0.5% were positive for N gonorrhoeae, 5.0% for T vaginalis and 20.9% for bacterial vaginosis. Genital tract infections were more prevalent in HIV-seropositive than seronegative women, statistically significant for syphilis (3.3% vs 0.7%), HSV-2 (43.2% vs 32.0%), genital ulcers (4.4% vs 1.4%) and bacterial vaginosis (37.2% vs 19.6%). In comparison with published data, a declining trend for curable STIs/RTIs (syphilis, trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis) was noted. Rates of STIs and RTIs are still high among pregnant women in Moshi. Where resources allow, routine screening and treatment of STIs/RTIs in the antenatal care setting should be offered. Higher STIs/RTIs in HIV-seropositive women supports the expansion of HIV-counseling and testing services to all centers offering antenatal care. After identification, STIs/RTIs need to be aggressively addressed in HIV-seropositive women, both at antenatal and antiretroviral therapy care clinics.",2009,Feb,Reproductive health,6,,4,,10.1186/1742-4755-6-4,19243592,#725,Msuya 2009,"",""
Sexually Transmitted Infections among HIV-1-Discordant Couples,"Guthrie, B. L.; Kiarie, J. N.; Morrison, S.; John-Stewart, G. C.; Kinuthia, J.; Whittington, W. L. H.; Farquhar, C.","Introduction: More new HIV-1 infections occur within stable HIV-1-discordant couples than in any other group in Africa, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may increase transmission risk among discordant couples, accounting for a large proportion of new HIV-1 infections. Understanding correlates of STIs among discordant couples will aid in optimizing interventions to prevent HIV-1 transmission in these couples. Methods: HIV-1-discordant couples in which HIV-1-infected partners were HSV-2-seropositive were tested for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, and HIV-1-uninfected partners were tested for HSV-2. We assessed sociodemographic, behavioral, and biological correlates of a current STI. Results: Of 416 couples enrolled, 16% were affected by a treatable STI, and among these both partners were infected in 17% of couples. A treatable STI was found in 46 (11%) females and 30 (7%) males. The most prevalent infections were trichomoniasis (5.9%) and syphilis (2.6%). Participants were 5.9-fold more likely to have an STI if their partner had an STI (P<0.01), and STIs were more common among those reporting any unprotected sex (OR = 2.43; P<0.01) and those with low education (OR = 3.00; P<0.01). Among HIV-1-uninfected participants with an HSV-2-seropositive partner, females were significantly more likely to be HSV-2-seropositive than males (78% versus 50%, P<0.01). Conclusions: Treatable STIs were common among HIV-1-discordant couples and the majority of couples affected by an STI were discordant for the STI, with relatively high HSV-2 discordance.

Are there acceptable alternatives to syndromic management for the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections in HIV positive kenyan women?,Woo V.; Cohen C.R.; Bukusi E.A.; Huchko M.J.,"Background: Control of sexually transmitting infections (STIs) is an important aspect of HIV prevention and care. Syndromic management for vaginal discharge, despite a recognised low sensitivity and specificity, is widely employed for STI management among HIV-1 infected women in resource-limited settings. In this pilot study, we evaluated the incremental increase in sensitivity and specificity of multiple, low-cost diagnostic strategies for non-ulcerative STIs diagnosed among HIV-1 infected women receiving care in Kenya. Methods: This cross-sectional study was done among a cohort of HIV-1 infected women enrolled at Family AIDS and Care and Treatment Services (FACES) clinics in Kisumu, Kenya. During their routine clinic visit, participants reported any health complaint and later were asked about general vaginal symptoms (brief symptom ascertainment) and specific complaints of pruritis, odour and discharge (detailed symptom ascertainment). Clients were then examined for cervicitis and vaginal discharge, followed by specimen collection for STI testing. Results: of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae nucleic acid amplification test and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) by wet mount was used as the gold standard for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Results: Of the 155 women who were screened between the ages of 23-53 years, the prevalence of N gonorrhoeae was 1.9% (3/155), TV was 6.4% (10/155) and no cases of C trachomatis were detected. See Abstract P3-S1.08 table 1. Conclusions: Syndromic management had a very poor sensitivity for detecting STIs in HIV-1 infected women. The addition of specific questions about STI-related symptoms improved STI detection rates, while a speculum exam led to greater sensitivity and specificity. The feasibility and effectiveness of alternative approaches such (Table presented) as routine use of speculum exams, and point-of-care testing for T vaginalis should be explored to improve the management of STIs among HIV-1 infected women in similar low-resource settings.",2011,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,87,"(Bukusi E.A.)

"Trichomonas Vaginalis detection and characterization from women attending an anti-retroviral clinic in Pretoria, South Africa",Rukasha I.; Ehlers M.M.; Kock M.M.,"Background: Trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas Vaginalis affects both men and women, although the clinical presentation differs. Infected women are more likely to have symptoms compared to infected men. Approximately 75% to 100% of men are asymptomatic in comparison to approximately 50% to 75% of women who are identified as asymptomatic. In South Africa, data on the prevalence and detection of T. Vaginalis is well-documented; however, data on the molecular characterization of T. Vaginalis is limited. The study aimed to detect and characterise T. Vaginalis isolates from HIV positive women attending an anti-retroviral clinic. Methods: Self-collected vaginal swabs from 380 HIV positive women were included in the study. Trichomonas Vaginalis was detected using wet mount microscopy, culture and a commercial PCR kit. The genetic relatedness of 92 culture positive T. Vaginalis isolates was determined. Five primers (TV1, TV2, TV3, TV5 and TV6) were used for the RAPD assay. The PCR-IGS-RFLP products were digested with five enzymes, namely: AluI, HinfI, RsaI, Sau3AI and Tsp509. Results: A total of 8% (30/380) of specimens were positive for T. Vaginalis using microscopy, 24% (92/380) of specimens were positive using culture and 31% (118/380) of the specimens were positive using the commercial PCR kit. RAPD assay analysis showed a high level of genetic diversity between the T. Vaginalis isolates. The dendrogrammes obtained from the RAPD data grouped the 92 T. Vaginalis isolates into between nine to 24 clusters with 70% similarity used to define clusters, while the PCR-IGS RFLP assay results for the isolates were genetically indistinguishable. Conclusion: The PCR assay was the most sensitive diagnostic tool for the detection of T. Vaginalis. A high prevalence of T.

A total of 206 HIV-positive women, 172 HIV-negative women and 22 women with unknown HIV status were recruited at the University Teaching Hospitals of Kigali (UTHK) and of Butare (UTHB) in Rwanda. Participants underwent an interview, cervical sampling for a Thinprep Pap test and a screening test analysing 37 HPV strains. Only 27% of HIV-positive women and 7% of HIV-negative women had been screened for cervical cancer before. HPV16 and HPV52 were the most common HPV strains. HIV-positive women were more commonly infected with high-risk (HR) HPV and multitype HPV than HIV-negative women. The sensitivity was 78% and the specificity 87% to detect high-grade SIL (HSIL) with HPV screening. Among HIV-negative women, being divorced was positively associated with HR-HPV infection, while hepatitis B, Trichomonas vaginalis infection and HR-HPV infection were factors positively associated with SILs. Ever having had gonorrhoea was positively associated with HR-HPV infection among HIV-positive women. HR-HPV infection and the number of live births were positively associated with SILs.

As part of a Nairobi perinatal cohort, HIV-1-infected pregnant women were interviewed and samples were collected for STIs and BV testing. Diagnostic accuracy of STIs and BV by syndromic algorithms was evaluated with comparison to the reference standard. Among 441 women, prevalence of BV was 37%, trichomoniasis 16%, chlamydia 4%, syphilis 3% and gonorrhoea 2%. Significantly more women with STIs were aged 21-years-old, had not attended secondary school and had a history of STIs. Syndromic diagnosis of STIs and BV demonstrated a sensitivity of 45% and 57%, and positive predictive value of 30% and 42%, respectively.

"Screenings for Chlamydia trachomatis antigen among HIV and non-HIV patients with symptoms of urogenital tract diseases at the Federal Medical Centre Gombe, Nigeria",Charanchi S.M.; Tahir F.,"C. trachomatis a sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen and the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) world wide can lead to serious complications in women and infants with untreated infections. Symptoms are normally unspecific, as such rapid screening tests with high specificity, though not confirmatory are highly valuable in converting its menace as large number of patients at high risk can be screened within a short period with ease in sample collection and patient management at very low cost. Three hundred urogenital swab samples; including 93 urethral swabs and 207 endocervical swabs were aseptically collected from patients with symptoms of urogenital tract diseases attending federal medical centre Gombe from January to March, 2010. Among them were 33 HIV patients and 267 non-HIV patients. All the swabs were subjected to Chlamydia antigen screening using Nova® One-Step Chlamydia trachomatis rapid immunochromatography antigen screening testing kits. In general, 11(3.7%) patients were found positive in this study. In the non-HIV patients, 2.6% were positive, with highest frequency of 3.1% recorded at the age group 21-30years. However in the HIV-patients, 12.1% were positive, with the highest frequency of 18.2% recorded at the age group 31-40years. The findings from this work has stressed the importance of rapid screening as a presumptive technique and call for use of more reliable confirmatory testing procedures in the prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), cervical carcinoma and other STDs.

Study Team","Objectives Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent curable STI worldwide and has been associated with adverse health outcomes and increased HIV-1 transmission risk. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among couples to assess how characteristics of both individuals in sexual partnerships are associated with the prevalence of male and female T. vaginalis infection. Methods African HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples were concurrently tested for trichomoniasis at enrolment into two clinical trials. T. vaginalis testing was by nucleic acid amplification or culture methods. Using Poisson regression with robust standard errors, we identified characteristics associated with trichomoniasis. Results Among 7531 couples tested for trichomoniasis, 981 (13%) couples contained at least one infected partner. The prevalence was 11% (n=857) among women and 4% (n=319) among men, and most infected individuals did not experience signs or symptoms of T. vaginalis. Exploring concordance of T. vaginalis status within sexual partnerships, we observed that 61% (195/319) of T. vaginalis-positive men and 23% (195/857) of T. vaginalis-positive women had a concurrently infected partner. In multivariable analysis, having a T. vaginalis-positive partner was the strongest predictor of infection for women (relative risk (RR) 4.70, 95% CI 4.10 to 5.38) and men (RR 10.09, 95% CI 7.92 to 12.85). For women, having outside sex partners, gonorrhoea, and intermediate or high Nugent scores for bacterial vaginosis were associated with increased risk of trichomoniasis, whereas age 45 years and above, being married, having children and injectable contraceptive use were associated with reduced trichomoniasis risk. Additionally, women whose male partners were circumcised, had more education or earned income had lower risk of trichomoniasis. Conclusions We found that within African HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples, the prevalence of trichomoniasis was high among partners of T. vaginalis-infected individuals, suggesting that partner services could play an important role identifying additional cases and preventing reinfection. Our results also suggest that male circumcision may reduce the risk of male-to-female T. vaginalis transmission.",2017,Nov,Sex Transm Infect,93,7,520-+,WOS:000413493800022,10.1136/sextrans-2016-053034,,#7060,Bochner 2017,"",""

To compare the prevalence of gynaecological conditions among HIV infected and non-infected pregnant women. Methods. Two thousand and eight (2008) pregnant women were screened for HIV, lower genital tract infections and lower genital tract neoplasia at booking antenatal visit. Results. About 10% (198/2008) were HIV positive. All lower genital tract infections except candidiasis were more prevalent among HIV positive compared to HIV negative women: vaginal candidiasis (36.9% vs 35.4%; p = 0.678), Trichomoniasis (21.2% vs 10.6%; p < 0.001), gonorrhoea (10.1% vs 2.5%; p < 0.001), bacterial vaginosis (21.2% vs 15.2%; p = 0.026), syphilis (35.9% vs 10.6%; p < 0.001), and Chlamydia trachomatis (38.4% vs 7.1%; p < 0.001).

Conclusion. We conclude that (i) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common in both HIV positive and HIV negative pregnant women in Cameroon, and (ii) STIs and preinvasive cervical lesions are more prevalent in HIV-infected pregnant women compared to their non-infected compatriots.

Antiretroviral Therapy Initiation Is Not Associated With Risky Sexual Behavior Among Heterosexual Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Persons in Serodiscordant Partnerships.,Mujugira A.; Celum C.; Ngure K.; Thomas KK.; Katabira E.; Baeten JM.;  .,"Few prospective studies have assessed whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) use is associated with changes in sexual risk behavior of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons in known HIV-serodiscordant partnerships. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of HIV-infected persons with known uninfected partners enrolled in the Partners Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Study in Kenya and Uganda. Antiretroviral therapy use and self-reported sexual behavior were ascertained every 3 months. We assessed the effect of ART on sexual risk behaviors using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Primary outcomes were condomless vaginal sex acts, pregnancy incidence and new sexually transmitted infection diagnoses. We followed 1817 HIV-infected persons (58% women) for 864 person-years before ART initiation and 771 person-years after ART. Median CD4 and plasma viral load at ART initiation were 277 cells/μL and 4.18 log10 copies/mL. Antiretroviral therapy use was associated with a significant decrease in condomless vaginal sex acts with HIV-uninfected partners (0.65 vs 0.39 per month; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.75; P < 0.001), but not condomless vaginal sex acts with nonprimary partners (1.30 vs 1.04 per month; rate ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.94-1.20; P = 0.62).

We used the Loess procedure to estimate the magnitude and timing of viral setpoints in plasma and cervical secretions and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to identify predictors of plasma and cervical viral setpoints. Results: We estimated the mean HIV-1 plasma setpoint to be 4.20 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.04-4.35] at 121 days (95% CI 91-137) from infection; an analogous mean cervical viral setpoint was 1.64 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/swab (95% CI 1.46-1.82) at 174 days (95% CI 145-194) from infection. Cervical loads were significantly higher (0.7-1.1 log10 copies/swab) during acute infection than subsequently. Subtype D infection, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and older age at the time of infection were associated with higher plasma viral setpoint. Subtype C infection, nonviral sexually transmitted infections, having a partner spending nights away from home, recent unprotected sex, and shorter time since infection were associated with higher cervical HIV-1 loads. Hormonal contraception was not associated with either the HIV-1 plasma setpoint or cervical loads during early infection.

The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of C. trachomatis and evaluate the diagnostic utility of serological markers namely anti-C. trachomatis IgG and IgA antibodies in women attending an infertility clinic. METHODS: Serum and vaginal swab specimens of 303 women presenting with infertility to the infertility clinic of the Kigali University Teaching Hospital and 312 fertile controls who recently delivered were investigated. Two commercial species-specific ELISA were used to determine serum IgG and IgA antibodies to C. trachomatis and vaginal swabs specimens were tested by PCR. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) was performed in subfertile women. RESULTS: The PCR prevalence of C. trachomatis infection was relatively low and did not differ significantly among subfertile and fertile women (3.3 versus 3.8%). Similarly, no significant differences in overall prevalence rates of C. trachomatis IgG and IgA among both groups were observed. The only factor associated with C. trachomatis infection in our study population was age <25 years. The seroprevalence of IgG in both assays (86.4% for ANILabsystems and 90.9% for Vircell) was significantly higher in the group of PCR C. trachomatis-positive women compared with that of PCR-negative women. Evidence of tubal pathology identified by HSG was found in 185 patients in the subfertile group (67.8%). All the serological markers measured in this study had very low sensitivities and negative predictive values in predicting tubal pathology. The specificities for ANILabsystems IgG, Vircell IgG, Anilabsystem IgA and positive C. trachomatis DNA to predict tubal pathology were 84, 86, 95 and 98%, respectively, whereas their respective positive predictive values were 73, 76, 81 and 80%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of C. trachomatis in our study population in Rwanda appears to be low and women aged <25 years are more likely to have genital infection with C. trachomatis. Since serological testing for Chlamydia shows an excellent negative predictive value for lower genital tract infection, specific peptide-based serological assays may be of use for screening in low prevalence settings.

Socio-demographic characteristics and sexual history were recorded. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the diagnosis of non-viral STIs. Two hundred and thirty-three participants (60.5%) had a confirmed positive result for at least one STI: HSV 2 prevalence 52.5%, TV 8.1%, CT 2.1%, NG 1.8% and TP 11.4%. Eighty-seven per cent of the women were asymptomatic for any STI; 62.3% of women with a non-viral STI were asymptomatic. Women who had attended tertiary education were 90% less likely to have a non-viral STI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.39, p < 0.01). Having more than three lifetime sexual partners was a significant predictor for a non-viral STI diagnosis (aOR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.5-7.2, p < 0.01). A high prevalence of predominantly asymptomatic STIs is reported in a cohort of HIV-infected women. Syndromic management results in underdiagnosis of asymptomatic patients.

A high burden of asymptomatic genital tract infections undermines the syndromic management approach among adolescents and young adults in South Africa: implications for HIV prevention efforts.,Kaida A.; Dietrich JJ.; Laher F.; Beksinska M.; Jaggernath M.; Bardsley M.; Smith P.; Cotton L.; Chitneni P.; Closson K.; Lewis DA.; Smit JA.; Ndung'u T.; Brockman M.; Gray G.,"Youth in southern Africa, particularly adolescent girls and young women, are a key population for HIV prevention interventions. Untreated genital tract infections (GTIs) increase both HIV transmission and acquisition risks. South African GTI treatment guidelines employ syndromic management, which relies on individuals to report GTI signs and symptoms. Syndromic management may, however, underestimate cases, particularly among youth. We compared genital tract infection (GTI) prevalence by symptom-based and laboratory assessment among sexually-experienced youth in South Africa, overall and stratified by sex. Interviewer-administered surveys assessed socio-demographics, behaviors, and GTI symptoms among 352 youth (16-24 yrs., HIV-negative or unknown HIV status at enrollment) enrolled in community-based cohorts in Durban and Soweto (2014-2016). Laboratory tests assessed HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infections and, among females, bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Candida species. Youth with genital ulcers were tested for HSV-2 and syphilis. We assessed sensitivity (and specificity) of symptom-based reporting in identifying laboratory-confirmed GTIs. At baseline, 16.2% of females (32/198) and < 1% (1/154) of males reported ≥1 GTI symptom. However, laboratory tests identified ≥1 GTI in 70.2% and 10.4%, respectively. Female CT prevalence was 18.2%, NG 7.1%, MG 9.6%, TV 8.1%, and 5.1% were newly diagnosed with HIV. BV prevalence was 53.0% and candidiasis 9.6%. One female case of herpes was identified (0 syphilis). Male CT prevalence was 7.8%, NG 1.3%, MG 3.3%, TV < 1%, and 2.0% were newly diagnosed with HIV. Overall, 77.8% of females and 100% of males with laboratory-diagnosed GTIs reported no symptoms or were asymptomatic. Sensitivity (and specificity) of symptom-based reporting was 14% (97%) among females and 0% (99%) among males. A high prevalence of asymptomatic GTIs and very poor sensitivity of symptom-based reporting undermines the applicability of syndromic GTI management, thus compromising GTI control and HIV prevention efforts among youth. Syndromic GTI management does not meet the sexual health needs of young people.

About 10% of global HIV-infected individuals live in Nigeria, of which 58% are women. The study analyzed risk and cofactors of MTCT in healthcare centers of Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria, between November 2014 and April 2016. Methods: A total of 240 pregnant women aged 19-43 years were recruited for the study, 114 HIV-seropositive mean age 31.81 years and 126 HIV-seronegative mean age 29.05 years as controls. High vaginal sawbs, breast milk, oropharynx, and neonates' nares were collected using sterile cotton-tipped applicator and introducing each into thioglycollate fluid medium for growth. Bacterial isolates were characterized by the standard microbiological methods and API kits. HIV serostatus of each participant was determined by HIV-1/2 strip and confirmed by Abbott enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure. Sexually transmitted infections were detected by the enzyme immunoassays using commercial kits. Results: A total of 2,148 bacterial isolates were recovered from both cohorts (911 from HIV-seropositive, 864 HIV-seronegative, and 373 from neonates' nares). Predominant pathogens recovered were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and diverse corynebacteria as commensals.

In Zimbabwe, women presenting with symptomatic vaginal discharge are treated with empirical regimens that commonly cover both sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and reproductive tract infections, typically including a combination of an intramuscular injection of kanamycin, and oral doxycycline and metronidazole regimens. This study was conducted to determine the current etiology of symptomatic vaginal discharge and assess adequacy of current syndromic management guidelines. We enrolled 200 women with symptomatic vaginal discharge presenting at 6 STI clinics in Zimbabwe. Microscopy was used to detect bacterial vaginosis and yeast infection. Nucleic acid amplifications tests were used to detect Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium. In addition, serologic testing was performed to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Most countries do not test for those infections during antenatal care. We implemented a CT, NG and TV testing and treatment programme in an antenatal clinic in Gaborone, Botswana. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in the antenatal clinic at Princess Marina Hospital in Gaborone, Botswana. We offered pregnant women who were 18 years or older and less than 35 weeks of gestation, CT, NG and TV testing using self-collected vaginal swabs. Testing was conducted using a GeneXpert® CT/NG and TV system. Those who tested positive were given directly observed antibiotic therapy and asked to return for a test of cure. We determined the prevalence of infections, uptake of treatment and proportion cured. The relationships between positive STI test and participant characteristics were assessed. RESULTS: We enrolled 400 pregnant women. Fifty-four (13.5%) tested positive for CT, NG and/or TV: 31 (8%) for CT, 5 (1.3%) for NG and 21 (5%) for TV. Among those who tested positive, 74% (40) received same-day, in person results and treatment. Among those who received delayed results (6), 67% (4) were treated. Statistical comparisons showed that being unmarried and HIV infected were positively association CT, NG and/or TV infection. Self-reported STI symptoms were not associated with CT, NG and/or TV infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CT, NG and/or TV was high, particularly among women with HIV infection. Among women with CT, NG and/or TV infection, those who received same-day results were more likely to be treated than those who received delayed results.

Interactions between this infection and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm labour, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, low birth weight and post-abortal sepsis. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of T. vaginalis infection amongst HIV-positive pregnant women attending antenatal care at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Lagos, Nigeria. This was an analytical cross-sectional study in which 320 eligible participants which included 160 HIV-positive (case group) and 160 HIV-negative (control group) pregnant women were recruited at the antenatal clinic of LUTH. A structured pro forma was used to collect data from consenting participants after which high vaginal swabs were collected, processed and examined for T. vaginalis. The association between categorical variables was tested using the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test where applicable. All significances were reported at P < 0.05. The prevalence of T. vaginalis infection amongst HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women were 10% and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.559).

The study was undertaken to provide information on the association between the hormonal contraceptive methods and vulvo vaginal candidiasis among women attending Family Planning clinics, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study in a population of women using hormonal contraceptive methods attending Family Planning clinics. Detailed medical history, endocervical and high vaginal swabs were collected from the women to establish diagnosis after clinical examination and informed consent. Aliquots of sera from venous blood samples of the women were tested for antibodies to HIV-1/2. Data was analysed using SPSS for windows' version 17.0. Results: There were 116 women using hormonal contraceptive methods who participated in the study with mean age of 28.70 years (SD = 6.72, range = 19 -54). The mean age of sexual debut of the women was 19.2 years (SD = 2.96). The prevalence of vulvo-vaginal candidosis was 23.3%.

Prevalence distribution of risk factors for HIV acquisition and spread were compared between the two areas. The prevalence of HIV-1 among pregnant women was 26% in Zimbabwe and 7% in Tanzania. The HIV prevalence in both countries rises constantly with age up to the 25-30 year age group. After that, it continues to rise among Zimbabwean women, while it drops for Tanzanian women. Risky sexual behaviour was more prominent among Tanzanians than Zimbabweans. Mobility and such infections as HSV-2, trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis were more prevalent among Zimbabweans than Tanzanians. Reported male partner circumcision rates between the two countries were widely different, but the effect of male circumcision on HIV prevalence was not apparent within the populations. The higher HIV-1 prevalence among pregnant women in Zimbabwe compared with Tanzania cannot be explained by differences in risky sexual behaviour: all risk factors tested for in our study were higher for Tanzania than Zimbabwe.

Mycoplasma hominis and Mycoplasma genitalium in the Vaginal Microbiota and Persistent High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Infection.,Adebamowo SN.; Ma B.; Zella D.; Famooto A.; Ravel J.; Adebamowo C.;  .,"Recent studies have suggested that the vaginal microenvironment plays a role in persistence of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection and thus cervical carcinogenesis. Furthermore, it has been shown that some mycoplasmas are efficient methylators and may facilitate carcinogenesis through methylation of hrHPV and cervical somatic cells. We examined associations between prevalence and persistence of Mycoplasma spp. in the vaginal microbiota, and prevalent as well as persistent hrHPV infections. We examined 194 Nigerian women who were tested for hrHPV infection using SPF25/LiPA10 and we identified Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma hominis in their vaginal microbiota established by sequencing the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We defined the prevalence of M. genitalium, M. hominis, and hrHPV based on positive result of baseline tests, while persistence was defined as positive results from two consecutive tests. We used exact logistic regression models to estimate associations between Mycoplasma spp. and hrHPV infections. The mean (SD) age of the study participants was 38 (8) years, 71% were HIV positive, 30% M. genitalium positive, 45% M. hominis positive, and 40% hrHPV positive at baseline.

Women were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus 2 by PCR, and candidal infections and bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain. Women with bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically chlamydia and gonorrhoea, had higher genital IL-17 concentrations than women with no STI, whereas women with candidal pseudohyphae/spores had lower IL-17 concentrations compared with women without candidal infections. Viral STIs (herpes simplex virus 2 and HIV) were not associated with significant changes in genital IL-17 concentrations. Genital IL-17 concentrations correlated strongly with other inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Although Th17 cells were depleted from blood during HIV infection, cervical Th17 cell frequencies were similar in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women. Cervical Th17 cell frequencies were also not associated with STIs or candida, although few women had a STI. These findings suggest that IL-17 production in the female genital tract is induced in response to bacterial but not viral STIs. Decreased IL-17 associated with candidal infections suggests that candida may actively suppress IL-17 production or women with dampened IL-17 responses may be more susceptible to candidal outgrowth",2015,Dec,Immunology,146,4,557-567,WOS:000368349600006,10.1111/imm.12527,,#5890,Masson 2015,"",""
HIV-1 epidemic among female bar and hotel workers in northern Tanzania: risk factors and opportunities for prevention.,Kapiga SH.; Sam NE.; Shao JF.; Renjifo B.; Masenga EJ.; Kiwelu IE.; Manongi R.; Fawzi W.; Essex M.,"We conducted this study to determine the prevalence and risk factors for HIV-1 infection among women (N = 312) who were working in the bars and hotels in Moshi, a town in northern Tanzania. Study subjects were interviewed to obtain information about HIV-1 risk factors and examined to collect samples for the diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The prevalence of HIV-1 was 26.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.4%-31.2%). In multivariate analyses, the risk of HIV-1 increased with increasing age (p value, test for linear trend <.001) and the number of sexual partners during the last 5 years (p value, test for linear trend <.03). Other significant predictors were having a male partner with other sexual partners (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.03-3.60), and consuming alcohol >2 days per week (AOR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.12-5.88). The risk of HIV-1 was also significantly increased in women with bacterial vaginosis (AOR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.09-5.13) and in study subjects with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 antibodies (AOR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.24-4.98). These results indicate that women working in these settings were at increased risk of HIV-1. Programs aiming at promoting safer sexual practices and control of other STDs are urgently needed in this population. Such programs should address the underlying conditions that facilitate risk behaviors and create obstacles for these women who wish to protect themselves against HIV-1.",2002,Apr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),29,4,409-17,,10.1097/00126334-200204010-00013,11917247,#1347,Kapiga 2002,"",""
"HIV Infection among Young People in Northwest Tanzania: The Role of Biological, Behavioural and Socio-Demographic Risk Factors.",Lemme F.; Doyle AM.; Changalucha J.; Andreasen A.; Baisley K.; Maganja K.; Watson-Jones D.; Kapiga S.; Hayes RJ.; Ross DA.,"Young people are at high risk of HIV and developing appropriate prevention programmes requires an understanding of the risk factors for HIV in this age group. We investigated factors associated with HIV among participants aged 15-30 years in a 2007-8 cross-sectional survey nested within a community-randomised trial of the MEMA kwa Vijana intervention in 20 rural communities in northwest Tanzania. We analysed data for 7259(53%) males and 6476(47%) females. Using a proximate-determinant conceptual framework and conditional logistic regression, we obtained sex-specific Odds Ratios (ORs) for the association of HIV infection with socio-demographic, knowledge, behavioural and biological factors. HSV-2 infection was strongly associated with HIV infection (females: adjOR 4.4, 95%CI 3.2-6.1; males: adjOR 4.2, 95%CI 2.8-6.2). Several socio-demographic factors (such as age, marital status and mobility), behavioural factors (condom use, number and type of sexual partnerships) and biological factors (blood transfusion, lifetime pregnancies, genital ulcers, Neisseria gonorrhoeae) were also associated with HIV infection. Among females, lifetime sexual partners (linear trend, p<0.001), ≥2 partners in the past year (adjOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.4-2.8), ≥2 new partners in the past year (adjOR 1.9 95%CI 1.2, 3.3) and concurrent partners in the past year (adjOR 1.6 95%CI 1.1, 2.4) were all associated with HIV infection. Efforts must be intensified to find effective interventions to reduce HSV-2. Effective behavioural interventions focusing on reducing the number of sexual partnerships and risk behaviour within partnerships are also needed. An increase in risky sexual behaviour may occur following marriage dissolution or when a young woman travels outside of her community and interventions addressing the needs of these subgroups of vulnerable women may be important.

Urethritis/cervicitis pathogen prevalence and associated risk factors among asymptomatic HIV-infected patients in South Africa.,Lewis DA.; Chirwa TF.; Msimang VM.; Radebe FM.; Kamb ML.; Firnhaber CS.,"To determine sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence, and patient characteristics associated with detection of urethritis/cervicitis pathogens, among HIV-infected individuals offered voluntary STI screening at a South African HIV treatment center. Individuals, asymptomatic for genital discharge, were screened for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) infections (real-time polymerase chain reaction assay), for syphilis and herpes simplex type 2 (serologically), and for bacterial vaginosis and Candida (microscopy, women only). Patients' most recent CD4 and viral load results were recorded. Demographic, clinical, and behavioral data were collected by nurse-administered questionnaire. Compared with men (n = 551), women (n = 558) were younger (mean age, 35.0 vs. 37.9 years; P < 0.001), reported more STIs in the past year (65.5% vs. 56.5%; P = 0.002), had more urethritis/cervicitis pathogens detected (21.3% vs.16.4%, P = 0.035), and were less aware of their partner's HIV status (53.1% vs. 62.3%; P = 0.007). The overall prevalence of individual urethritis/cervicitis pathogens was TV (7.6%), MG (6.1%), NG (5.4%), and C. trachomatis (2.1%). Multivariate analysis highlighted 4 significant factors associated with the detection of specific urethritis/cervicitis pathogens, namely female gender (TV, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47-4.37), having a regular sexual partner in the past 3 months (NG, aOR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.01-5.08), suboptimal condom use with regular partners (TV, aOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.25-3.42), and a history of genital warts in the past year (NG, 2.25, 95% CI: 1.26-4.03). Asymptomatic urethritis/cervicitis pathogens were highly prevalent in this population. Few urethritis/cervicitis pathogen-associated patient characteristics were identified, emphasizing the need for affordable STI diagnostics to screen HIV-infected patients.",2012,Jul,Sexually transmitted diseases,39,7,531-6,,10.1097/OLQ.0b013e31824cbecc,22706215,#1793,Lewis 2012,"",""
"Trends and associations of Trichomonas vaginalis infection in men and women with genital discharge syndromes in Johannesburg, South Africa.",Lewis DA.; Marsh K.; Radebe F.; Maseko V.; Hughes G.,"To better understand the epidemiology of Trichomonas vaginalis infection, we investigated the association between T vaginalis and demographic, clinical, microbiological and behavioural characteristics of patients presenting with genital discharges to a primary healthcare clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. During six annual surveys (2007-2012), 1218 cases of male urethral discharge syndrome and 1232 cases of vaginal discharge syndrome were consecutively recruited. Diagnostic methods included nucleic acid amplification (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, T vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium), microscopy (bacterial vaginosis and Candida) and serology (Treponema pallidum, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and HIV). Logistic regression analyses and χ2 tests were used to identify predictors of T vaginalis infection. The prevalence of T vaginalis decreased from 2007 to 2012 (men from 13.4% to 4.8%; women from 33.8 to 23.1%). Overall, 74 (6.1%) men and 291 (23.6%) women were T vaginalis positive, with the highest prevalence in those aged ≥40 years (men 13.6%; women 30.9%). T vaginalis infection occurred more often in pregnant women (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.67; 95% CI 1.29 to 5.54) and in women with serological evidence of T pallidum (aOR 1.63; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.45) or HSV-2 infections (aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.64). T vaginalis infection occurred less often in men with coexistent gonorrhoea (aOR 0.35; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.57) and in women with either bacterial vaginosis (aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82) or Candida morphotypes (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.86).

Women provided demographic, behavioural and medical information, and underwent medical evaluation, including a pelvic exam. We computed crude and adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using log-binomial regression. Of 463 women screened, 457 provided laboratory specimens and were included in the analysis. The median age was 25 years, interquartile range (21-28), and 68.5% had completed primary or lower education. Overall, 72.2% tested positive for any STI or BV. Point prevalence was 55.6, 38.5, 3.9, 2.0, 4.6, and 14.7% for HSV-2, BV, GC, SYP, CT, and HIV, respectively. Co-infection with HSV-2, BV, and HIV occurred in 28 (6.1%) participants. Having ≥1 STI/BV was associated with younger age at first sex (≤13 versus 17-19 years, aPR=1.27, 95% CI 1.07-1.51), history of exchange sex (aPR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.07-3.92), sexual intercourse in the past seven days (aPR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.36), and older age (30-34 versus 18-24 years, aPR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.48). STI/BV diagnosis was less likely for women reporting one lifetime sexual partner compared to women with ≥4 lifetime sexual partners (aPR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.92).
