Human papillomaviruses prevalence and genital co-infections in HIV-seropositive women in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso),Sagna T.; Djigma F.; Zeba M.; Bisseye C.; Karou S.D.; Ouermi D.; Pietra V.; Gnoula C.; Sanogo K.; Nikiema J.B.; Simpore J.,"The vaginal swabs among HIV-positive women in Africa often revealed opportunistic infections such as human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Mycoplasma that induce respectively cervix cancer and diseases such as vaginosis, abortions, infertility in through salpingitis. The purposes of this study were to: (1) seek for, the prevalence of pathogens such as HPV and Mycoplasma; (2) characterize the strains of HPV and estimate their prevalence; (3) identify among these women, those who were co-infected by these pathogens in order to cure them. From February 2009 to January 2010, 156 HIV-positive women attending our medical centers and aged from 19-45 years (mean age 33.65±5.75 years) had voluntarily accepted vaginal specimen's tests. PCR, ELISA and molecular hybridization were used for the identification and characterization of these pathogens. The results revealed the presence of Mycoplasma and HPV in 25.64 and 58.33% cases, respectively. The following HPV genotypes and the following prevalence were recorded: HPV-50′S (24.11%), HPV-18 (21.28%), HPV-30'S (18.44%) andHPV-16 (5.67%). The study also enable the identification of co-infections such as HPV-18 strains with HPV-30'S (5.67%) and HPV-30'S with HPV-50'S (3.55%). Other germs infecting the female genital tract including Candida albicans (20.51%), Escherichia co/z (12.18%), Treponema pallidum (3.85%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3.21 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (1.92%) were isolated.

"Vulnerability and risk factors for sexually transmitted infections and HIV among adolescents in Kampala, Uganda.",Råssjö EB.; Mirembe FM.; Darj E.,"Three hundred and six sexually experienced adolescents participated in a study on sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence and associated risk factors. The prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoea (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and syphilis was 4.5%, 9%, 8% and 4% for females and 4.7%, 5.7%, 0% and 2.8% for males. HIV-seropositivity was found in 15.2% of females and 5.8% of males. Structured face-to-face interviews were used to obtain information about social background, sexual experience and genital symptoms. Four focus-group discussions were used in order to validate the interview data. Females were more likely to be infected by the four treatable STIs and HIV, despite risky behavior being more common among males. Unemployment, little formal education, the presence of bacterial STIs and post-coital bleeding or a bad smell from the vagina was highly associated with the risk for HIV in females. The higher prevalence of STIs, including HIV, among adolescent girls cannot be explained by sexual behavior only, as boys reported more risk behavior and were still less affected by STIs. Biological and social factors are definitely of importance.",2006,Oct,AIDS care,18,7,710-6,,10.1080/09540120500302934,16971279,#1681,Råssjö 2006,Exclusion reason: 8.

Prevalence and Detection of Trichomonas vaginalis in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women.,Price CM.; Peters RPH.; Steyn J.; Mudau M.; Olivier D.; De Vos L.; Morikawa E.; Kock MM.; Medina-Marino A.; Klausner JD.,"Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted infection associated with increased transmission of HIV and significant adverse birth outcomes; culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are commonly used in diagnosis. Consenting HIV-infected pregnant women were recruited from clinics in South Africa and screened for T. vaginalis using PCR. Polymerase chain reaction-positive women provided an additional sample for culture. We compared T. vaginalis detection between PCR and culture, and investigated how PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values differ among culture results. A total of 359 women were enrolled and 76 (20%) tested T. vaginalis PCR positive. Cultures were obtained from 61 of the PCR-positive women, and 38 (62%) were culture positive. The median baseline Ct of the PCR-positive/culture-positive group was 22.6 versus 38.0 among those who were PCR positive/culture negative (P < 0.001). Culture-positive cases had lower Ct values (higher DNA load); a Ct value less than 30 predicted positivity with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96%. Culture was positive in roughly half of PCR-positive cases. The culture-negative cases had significantly higher Ct values, indicating a lower concentration of T. vaginalis DNA. A Ct value of 30 provides a reliable threshold for predicting culture positivity. The clinical significance of culture-negative infections detected by PCR is still unclear.",2018,05,Sexually transmitted diseases,45,5,332-336,,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000756,29465686,#1683,Price 2018,Exclusion reason: 2.

"Twelve-Month Antiretroviral Therapy Suppresses Plasma and Genital Viral Loads but Fails to Alter Genital Levels of Cytokines, in a Cohort of HIV-Infected Rwandan Women.",Ondoa P.; Gautam R.; Rusine J.; Lutter R.; Jurriaans S.; Kootstra N.; Karita E.; van de Wijgert J.,"Genital viral load (GVL) is the main determinant of sexual transmission of human immune-deficiency virus (HIV). The effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on local cervico-vaginal immunological factors associated with GVL is poorly described. We aimed to identify the risk factors of detectable GVL, and the impact of ART on HIV genital shedding and its correlates in a cohort of HIV-infected women, attending HIV care in Kigali, Rwanda. All participants were evaluated for GVL, plasma viral load (PVL), CD4 count, various sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) at baseline and at month 12. Genital concentration of 19 cytokines and mRNA expression of APOBEC3G and BST2, two host HIV restriction factors, were evaluated at baseline in all participants. Cytokine levels were re-assessed at month 12 only in participants eligible for ART at baseline. Risk factors of GVL ≥ 40 copies/mL at baseline and month 12 were assessed using logistic regression. Effect of 12-month ART on various local and systemic immunological parameters was examined using a paired t-test and McNemar as appropriate. 96 of the 247 women enrolled in the study were eligible for ART. After 12 months of ART, PVL and GVL decreased to undetectable level in respectively 74 and 88% of treated participants. ART did not affect cytokine levels. HIV genital shedding occurred only when PVL was detectable. At baseline, GVL was independently associated with IL-1β after controlling for PVL, age and N. gonorrhea infection (95% CI 1.32-2.15) and at month 12 with MIP-1β (95% CI 0.96-21.32) after controlling for baseline GVL, PVL and month 12 IL-8. Suppressive ART does not necessarily reduce genital level of immune activation. Minimizing all conditions favoring genital inflammation, including active detection and treatment of STIs, might reduce the risk of HIV transmission as supplement to the provision of potent ART.",2015,,PloS one,10,5,e0127201,,10.1371/journal.pone.0127201,26010956,#1896,Ondoa 2015,Exclusion reason: 2.

Sexual risk behaviour in a cohort of HIV-negative and HIV-positive Rwandan women,Mukanyangezi M.F.; Manzi O.; Tobin G.; Rulisa S.; Bienvenu E.; Giglio D.,"Here we wanted to assess whether sexual risk behaviour differs dependent by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status by following 100 HIV-A nd 137 HIV+ women recruited at two university teaching hospitals in Rwanda. Women were tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs; trichomoniasis, syphilis, hepatitis B and C) and for reproductive tract infections (RTIs; candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis (BV)) and were interviewed at baseline and 9 months later. BV was the most prevalent infection, while syphilis was the most common STI with a 9-month incidence of 10.9% in HIV+ women. Only 24.5% of women positive for any RTI/STI contacted their health facility and got treatment. More HIV-women than HIV+ women had had more than one sexual partner and never used condoms during the follow-up period.

High prevalence of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections among human immunodeficiency virus-infected pregnant women in a low-income South African community.,Mudau M.; Peters RP.; De Vos L.; Olivier DH.; J Davey D.; Mkwanazi ES.; McIntyre JA.; Klausner JD.; Medina-Marino A.,"There is a lack of evidence on the burden of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) among HIV-infected pregnant women in South Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of HIV-infected pregnant women in two healthcare facilities in a South African township to determine the prevalence of CT, NG and TV. HIV-infected pregnant women were recruited during the first antenatal care visit for their current pregnancy and requested to self-collect vulvovaginal swab specimens. Specimens were tested for CT, NG and TV using the Xpert® assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). Of 247 tested for CT, NG and TV, 47.8% tested positive for at least one organism; CT = 36.8%, TV = 23.9%, NG = 6.9%. Forty three (17.4%) had multiple infections, of which 42 included CT as one of the infecting organisms. Of the 118 participants who tested positive for at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI), 23.7% reported STI-like symptoms. Among women who tested positive for CT, 29.7% reported symptoms while 47.1 and 27.1% of those who tested positive for NG and TV, respectively, reported symptoms. The high STI prevalence coupled with the low symptom prevalence among infected individuals justifies the use of diagnostic screening approaches rather than syndromic management of STIs in this setting.",2018,03,International journal of STD & AIDS,29,4,324-333,,10.1177/0956462417724908,28799824,#1996,Mudau 2018,Exclusion reason: 2.

"Reproductive tract infections and the risk of HIV among women in Moshi, Tanzania.",Msuya SE.; Mbizvo E.; Stray-Pedersen B.; Sundby J.; Sam NE.; Hussain A.,"The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of HIV and reproductive tract infections (RTIs); to compare the occurrence of RTIs among HIV-infected and non-infected women; and to assess the association of HIV with RTIs and behavioral factors among women aged 15-49 years. A cross-sectional study was conducted in late 1999 among 382 consenting women attending three primary healthcare clinics. They were interviewed and screened for HIV-1 and RTIs. The prevalence of HIV-1 was 11.5%. Sixty-four percent of the women had one ongoing treatable RTI. Endogenous and sexually transmitted RTIs were higher in HIV-positive than negative women and 84% of the HIV seropositive women were co-infected with one treatable RTI. HIV was significantly associated with cervicitis (chlamydial or gonococcal) [OR = 3.2 (CI 1.1-13.2)], HSV-2 [OR = 2.6 (CI 1.3-5.1)], bacterial vaginosis [OR = 1.9 (CI 1.1-4.1)], genital warts [OR = 4.8 (CI 1.1-22.2)], and presence of vaginal discharge [OR = 2.7 (CI 1.3-5.2)]. Having more than one lifetime sexual partner, a history of infant mortality or a partner who had other wives or resided away from home > 6 months, were risk factors for HIV infection. HIV-1 and RTIs are a major public health problem among women in this population. Integration of routine screening and treatment of RTIs in the reproductive health clinics will be an important strategy to combat HIV in the area.

In 2002-2004, consenting women (N = 2654), attending primary health clinics for routine antenatal care were interviewed, examined and biological samples collected for diagnosis of HIV and other sexually transmitted/reproductive tract infections. The prevalence of HIV was 6.9%. The risk for HIV was greater among women whose male partner; had other sexual partners (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 15.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.39-27.20), traveled frequently (AOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.22-2.65) or consumed alcohol daily (AOR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.06-2.67). Other independent predictors of HIV were age, number of sex partners, recent migration, and presence of bacterial vaginosis, genital ulcer, active syphilis and herpes simplex virus type 2.

"Interrelationships among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, bacterial vaginosis, Trichomoniasis, and the presence of yeasts",Moodley P.; Connolly C.; Sturm A.W.,"Vaginal discharge of mixed etiology occurs frequently, with abnormal vaginal flora being the most common condition. The interrelationships among the disturbance of the vaginal ecology, the presence of yeasts, and infection with Trichomonas vaginalis and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were investigated among women presenting to a sexually transmitted diseases service. Analysis was done for 598 women. Although the prevalence of HIV-1 infection increased linearly with increasing Nugent's score (bacterial vaginosis score of Gram stain), the prevalence of T. vaginalis increased suddenly, from 12% in patients with a Nugent's score of ≤3 to 33% in patients with a score of 4, and remained at this level at higher scores. Yeast colonization and vulvovaginal candidiasis were inversely related to Nugent's scores. T. vaginalis might be responsible for the change in normal vaginal flora and may, therefore, be one of the causes of bacterial vaginosis. This could lead to more effective HIV-1 acquisition.",2002,,Journal of Infectious Diseases,185,1,69-73,,10.1086/338027,,#2145,Moodley 2002,Exclusion reason: 2. Data overlap with other study; ,""

"The prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium and association with HIV infection in symptomatic patients, Johannesburg, South Africa, 2007-2014.",Mahlangu MP.; Müller EE.; Venter JM.; Maseko DV.; Kularatne RS.,"Mycoplasma genitalium is associated with genital discharge syndrome, but limited prevalence data is available in South Africa. The prevalence rates of M. genitalium infection and HIV co-infection were determined in urogenital specimens collected from male and female patients presenting with genital discharge syndrome to a primary health care centre in Johannesburg, South Africa from 2007 through 2014. Genital specimens from 4731 patients were tested by a validated in-house multiplex real-time PCR assay for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis and M. genitalium. Sera were tested for HIV infection using the Determine™ HIV 1/2 and Unigold™ assays. The relative prevalence of M. genitalium in males and females was 8.9% and 10.6%, respectively. The prevalence of HIV infection in those infected with M. genitalium, without other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), was significantly higher than in those without M. genitalium infection (48.9% v 40.5%, p=0.014). This significant difference in HIV seroprevalence was particularly observed among females in the study cohort. The relative prevalence of M. genitalium and its association with prevalent HIV among females with vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) calls for further research on the potential role of M. genitalium in the transmission and acquisition of HIV.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

"Detection of trichomonas vaginalis in HIV positive women in Pretoria, South Africa",Kock M.; Rukasha I.; Dijkmans A.; Hoosen A.,"Background: The aim of this study was to detect Trichomonas vaginalis infection in HIV positive women receiving anti-retroviral therapy in Pretoria, South Africa. Methods: Self-collected vaginal swab specimens from 95 consecutive patients attending the anti-retroviral clinic (Tshwane District Hospital) were analysed. Trichomonas vaginalis was diagnosed by wet mount microscopy, culture using InPouch and a commercial PCR assay targeting the DNA repeat units. Trichomoniasis was diagnosed if any test was positive. Results: Five (5.3%) of the 95 specimens were positive by wet mount microscopy, 21 (22.1%) were culture positive and 28 (29.5%) were detected by PCR. All culture and wet mount positive specimens were PCR positive. The sensitivity and specificity of wet mount microscopy compared to culture were 23.8% and 98.7% respectively. PCR detected seven additional positive specimens than culture. The specificity of PCR compared to culture was 100%, with a sensitivity of 90.5%. The prevalence of T vaginalis was found to be 29.5% in this study. Conclusions: Previous studies in South Africa focused on the prevalence of trichomoniasis in pregnant women and women without HIV status and from lower socio-economic groups. This is the first report in HIV positive women receiving ARV treatment. There was a high prevalence (29.5%) of T vaginalis in this group. This is similar to that reported from Nigeria (24.4%) and Ivory Coast (27.0%), whilst the rate reported in Congolese (18.6%) HIV positive women was lower. Using microscopy alone for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis as is the current practice in most laboratories in South Africa is inadequate and leads to missed infections.",2011,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,87,"(Dijkmans A.)

Sexual Behaviors of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Pregnant Women and Factors Associated With Sexually Transmitted Infection in South Africa.,Joseph Davey D.; Peters RPH.; Kojima N.; Mudau M.; De Vos L.; Olivier D.; McIntyre JA.; Klausner JD.; Medina-Marino A.,"Sexual behaviors in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women in South Africa are not well understood. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected pregnant women were recruited into a prospective cohort at first antenatal care visit. Sociodemographic information and self-collected vulvovaginal swab samples were collected from participants. Vulvovaginal swab samples were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, and Trichomonas vaginalis using GeneXpert. We investigated sexual behaviors, alcohol use, factors associated with condomless sex during pregnancy, and prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) among our cohort. We report descriptive, univariate and multivariable logistic regression results of sexual behaviors and alcohol use, factors associated with condomless sex at last sex, and having any STI during pregnancy adjusting for a priori confounders. We recruited and enrolled 430 HIV-infected pregnant women. Median age was 30 years; median gestational age was 20 weeks. Eighty-nine percent of women reported sex during pregnancy. At last sex, 68% reported condomless sex; 18% reported having more than 1 sex partner in the past 12 months. Adjusting for age, income and relationship status, condom use at last sex was associated with prior knowledge of HIV status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-3.92) and being in a concordant HIV-positive (aOR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.84-5.50), or serodiscordant relationship (aOR, 6.50; 95% CI, 3.59-11.80). The prevalence of any STI was 41% (95% CI, 36%-45%). Adjusting for mothers' age and employment, odds of having an STI increased if the woman reported alcohol use during pregnancy (aOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.06-3.64) or if the father of the child was a non-cohabiting or casual partner (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.97-2.03). Almost all HIV-infected pregnant women were sexually active during pregnancy and most women reported condomless sex at last sex.

Association of Bacterial vaginosis and other Sexually Transmitted Infections with HIV among pregnant women in Nigeria.,Imade GE.; Musa J.; Sagay AS.; Kapiga SH.; Sankale JL.; Idoko J.; Kanki P.,"To determine the association of Bacterial vaginosis (BV) and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs) with HIV prevalence among pregnant women in Jos, Nigeria. This was a cross- sectional study of pregnant women who participated in the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV program of the AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria, between April 2002 and July 2004, at the Jos University Teaching Hospital in Jos, Nigeria. Blood, high vaginal and endocervical samples were obtained for diagnosis of HIV, BV and other STIs. Data were analyzed for prevalence of HIV, BV and other STIs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models generated unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) as well as 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the association of BV and other STIs with HIV prevalence. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 4,046 pregnant women were studied and 97.6% (3,950/4,046) had complete laboratory records for analysis. The prevalence of HIV was 8.2% (CI: 7.4-9.1); BV 11.9% (CI: 10.9-12.9); Candida 10.7% (CI: 9.7-11.7); mixed infection of BV and Candida 2.8% (CI: 2.3-3.4); Trichomonads 0.6% (CI: 0.3-0.8) and syphilis 0.35% (0.16-0.54).

"HIV-infected women of Burkina Faso: A ""reservoir"" of mycoplasma infection",Djigma F.; Ouedraogo C.; Sagna T.; Ouermi D.; Sanogo K.; Bisseye C.; Kabre A.; Pietra V.; Simpore J.; Nikiema J.-B.; Musumeci S.,"Introduction: The objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 HIV-positive compared to 200 HIV-negative women at the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service of Saint Camille Medical Center Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). Methodology: After revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. Results: Among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, we identified respectively: Mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus 5.5%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection M. hominis with U. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); Candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); E. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. The Nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of BV, was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxitocica, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence ranging from 0% to 5%. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the HIV-positive women of Burkina Faso are frequently affected by BV and represent a reservoir for mycoplasma infection.

Factors associated with HIV infection in married or cohabitating couples in Kenya: results from a nationally representative study.,Kaiser R.; Bunnell R.; Hightower A.; Kim AA.; Cherutich P.; Mwangi M.; Oluoch T.; Dadabhai S.; Mureithi P.; Mugo N.; Mermin J.;  .,"In order to inform prevention programming, we analyzed HIV discordance and concordance within couples in the Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) 2007. KAIS was a nationally representative population-based sero-survey that examined demographic and behavioral indicators and serologic testing for HIV, HSV-2, syphilis, and CD4 cell counts in 15,853 consenting adults aged 15-64 years. We analyzed interview and blood testing data at the sexual partnership level from married or cohabitating couples. Multivariable regression models were used to identify factors independently associated with HIV discordant and concordant status. Of 3256 couples identified in the survey, 2748 (84.4%) had interview and blood testing data. Overall, 3.8% of couples were concordantly infected with HIV, and in 5.8% one partner was infected, translating to 338,000 discordant couples in Kenya. In 83.6% of HIV-infected Kenyans living in married or cohabitating couples neither partner knew their HIV status. Factors independently associated with HIV-discordance included young age in women (AOR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8; p<0.0001), increasing number of lifetime sexual partners in women (AOR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.8; p<0.0001), HSV-2 infection in either or both partners (AOR 4.1, 95% CI: 2.3-7.2; p<0.0001), and lack of male circumcision (AOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.5; p = 0.032). Independent factors for HIV-concordance included HSV-2 infection in both partners (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.3-18.7; p = 0.001) and lack of male circumcision (AOR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0-3.3; p = 0.043).

Prevalence of HIV among women with vaginal discharge in a gynecological clinic.,Anorlu R.; Imosemi D.; Odunukwe N.; Abudu O.; Otuonye M.,"Vaginal discharge is a common complaint among women with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in Nigeria. Given the association between STDs and HIV and the alarming rise in the prevalence of HIV in Nigeria, we performed this study to determine the prevalence of HIV in patients with vaginal discharge. Between April 2000 and August 2000, women who attended the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and complained of vaginal discharge were adequately counseled for HIV serotest. High vaginal/endocervical swabs and venous blood were taken for microbiological studies and HIV serotest, respectively. Out of the 230 women counseled for HIV serotest 140 (60.9%) consented. The mean age of the 140 was 31.1+/-6.9 years (range 18-50 years). In 31 (22.1%), Candida albicans was isolated, in 26 Gardnerella vaginalis (18.8%), in 17 Staphylococcal spp. (12.1%); and E. coli, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neisseria gonococcus in 7.9%, 4.3%, and 1.4%, respectively. Four (2.9%) of the 140 patients were HIV seropositive, and all had Candida albicans isolated. The prevalence of HIV among patients with Candida albicans was 12.9%.

Contraceptive use and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among women seeking termination of pregnancy at a district hospital in kwazulu-natal,Muruya S.; Sebitloane H.,"Termination of pregnancy (TOP) is one of the components of female reproductive health and rights that are freely available in South Africa within the public health system, and yet unwanted pregnancies still remain a challenge. The objectives of this study were to determine the level of knowledge and use of contraceptive methods among women seeking TOP services and to evaluate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections in this group of women. This population-based study was conducted at Northdale Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal. Four hundred and ninety-seven women seeking TOP were interviewed over a period of six months, using a structured questionnaire. The mean age of the women was 25 years. The majority of the participants were black Africans (n = 424, 85.3%,) and single (n = 423, 85%), respectively. Most participants (n = 354, 71%) were unemployed, having obtained a secondary school education level. The majority (n = 420, 84.5%) indicated that they had previously used some form of contraception. However, condom use was used by only 18% (n = 78). The HIV prevalence among women requesting TOP was 39%.

Increased interleukin-10 in the the endocervical secretions of women with non-ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases: a mechanism for enhanced HIV-1 transmission?,Cohen CR.; Plummer FA.; Mugo N.; Maclean I.; Shen C.; Bukusi EA.; Irungu E.; Sinei S.; Bwayo J.; Brunham RC.,"Although non-ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and bacterial vaginosis are implicated as cofactors in heterosexual HIV-1 transmission, the mechanisms have not been defined. Recent in vitro data suggest that interleukin (IL)-10 may increase susceptibility of macrophages to HIV-1 infection. Therefore, we performed this study to assess whether non-ulcerative STD are associated with detection of IL-10 in the female genital tract. Women with clinical pelvic inflammatory disease with or without cervicovaginal discharge were recruited from an STD clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. Endocervical and endometrial specimens were obtained for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis DNA detection, Trichonomas vaginalis culture, and CD4 and CD8 T-cell enumeration. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed by Gram stain. IL-10 was detected in endocervical specimens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood was obtained for HIV-1 serology.

Cross-sectional study, using standardized methods, including a standardized questionnaire and standardized laboratory tests, in four cities in sub-Saharan Africa. In each city, a random sample of about 2000 adults aged 15-49 years was taken. Consenting men and women were interviewed about their socio-demographic characteristics and their sexual behaviour, and were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, and (women only) Trichomonas vaginalis infection. Risk factor analyses were carried out for chlamydial infection and syphilis seroreactivity. The prevalence of gonorrhoea ranged between 0% in men in Kisumu and 2.7% in women in Yaoundé. Men and women in Yaoundé had the highest prevalence of chlamydial infection (5.9 and 9.4%, respectively). In the other cities, the prevalence of chlamydial infection ranged between 1.3% in women in Cotonou and 4.5% in women in Kisumu. In Ndola, the prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity was over 10% in both men and women; it was around 6% in Yaoundé, 3-4% in Kisumu, and 1-2% in Cotonou. Chlamydial infection was associated with rate of partner change for both men and women, and with young age for women. At the population level, the prevalence of chlamydial infection correlated well with reported rates of partner change. Positive syphilis serology was associated with rate of partner change and with HSV-2 infection. The latter association could be due to biological interaction between syphilis and HSV-2 or to residual confounding by sexual behaviour. At the population level, there was no correlation between prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity and reported rates of partner change. Differences in prevalence of chlamydial infection could be explained by differences in reported sexual behaviour, but the variations in prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity remained unexplained.

HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention efficacy with South African adolescents over 54 months.,Jemmott JB.; Jemmott LS.; O'Leary A.; Ngwane Z.; Lewis DA.; Bellamy SL.; Icard LD.; Carty C.; Heeren GA.; Tyler JC.; Makiwane MB.; Teitelman A.,"Little research has tested HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk-reduction interventions' effects on early adolescents as they age into middle and late adolescence. This study tested whether intervention-induced reductions in unprotected intercourse during a 12-month period endured over a 54-month period and whether the intervention reduced the prevalence of STIs, which increase risk for HIV. Grade 6 learners (mean age = 12.4 years) participated in a 12-month trial in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, in which 9 matched pairs of schools were randomly selected and within pairs randomized to a theory-based HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention or an attention-control intervention. They completed 42- and 54-month postintervention measures of unprotected intercourse (the primary outcome), other sexual behaviors, theoretical constructs, and, at 42- and 54-month follow-up only, biologically confirmed curable STIs (chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis) and herpes simplex virus 2. The HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention reduced unprotected intercourse averaged over the entire follow-up period (OR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.22, 0.84]), an effect not significantly reduced at 42- and 54-month follow-up compared with 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. The intervention caused positive changes on theoretical constructs averaged over the 5 follow-ups, although most effects weakened at long-term follow-up. Although the intervention's main effect on STIs was nonsignificant, an Intervention Condition × Time interaction revealed that it significantly reduced curable STIs at 42-month follow-up in adolescents who reported sexual experience.

"High prevalence of obesity among women who enrolled in HIV prevention trials in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: healthy diet and life style messages should be integrated into HIV prevention programs.",Wand H.; Ramjee G.,"In South Africa, poverty and the dual epidemics of HIV and tuberculosis underscore the need for prevention efforts for obesity. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of obesity in a cohort of South African women and discuss the implications for public health practices. A total of 5,495 HIV-negative women from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa enrolled in three microbicide trials during the period of 2002-2008 were categorised as normal weight (body mass index (BMI: 18.6-<25), overweight (BMI: 25-<30) or obese (BMI: 30+). Incidence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia and gonorrhoea were also estimated and compared by BMI groups. Combined data was analysed using STATA 10.0. Approximately 70% of the sample population was classified as being overweight or obese. Older age and lack of education were determined to be significant predictors of obesity. Women who were 35 years or older were more than three times as likely to be overweight and more than 12 times as likely to be obese compared to the youngest group. The highest HIV and STI incidence rates were observed among those with BMI <25 kg/m(2) (normal weight) compared to women with BMI more than 25 kg/m2 (8.1 and 19.8 per 100 person-year respectively, P<0.001, both).

This study aimed to find out the prevalence of reproductive-organ disease in a sample of rural Gambian women. A questionnaire on reproductive health was administered by fieldworkers to women aged 15-54 years living in a rural area under demographic surveillance. A female gynaecologist questioned and examined the women (including speculum and bimanual pelvic examinations). Vaginal swabs were taken to test for Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, and bacterial vaginosis, cervical smears for cytology, cervical swabs for Chlamydia trachomatis PCR and Neisseria gonorrhoeae culture, and venous blood for haemoglobin, HIV, herpes simplex virus 2, and syphilis serology. 1348 (72.0%) of 1871 eligible women took part. Reproductive-organ symptoms were more likely to be reported to the gynaecologist (52.7% of women) than to the fieldworker (26.5%). Menstrual problems, abnormal vaginal discharge, and vaginal itching were the most commonly reported symptoms. A minority of women said they had sought health care for their symptoms.

Prevalence of pregnancy-relevant infections in a rural setting of Ghana.,Völker F.; Cooper P.; Bader O.; Uy A.; Zimmermann O.; Lugert R.; Groß U.,"Although infectious diseases still account for a high burden of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, simultaneous investigations on multiple infections affecting maternal and child health are missing. We conducted a cross-sectional, single-centre pilot study in a rural area of Ghana to assess the infectiological profile during pregnancy. Screening of 180 expectant mothers was done by vaginal swabs and serology to detect the most common pregnancy-relevant infections. They were also interviewed for potential risk factors, outcome of previous pregnancies, and socio-economic aspects. We found a high prevalence of infections caused by hepatitis B virus (16.7% HBs antigen positive). In contrast, infections caused by hepatitis C virus (1.1% anti-HCV) and HIV (0.6%) were rare. Maternal malaria was frequent (10.6%), despite increasing acceptance of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp). Group B streptococci were present in 10.6% of all pregnant women. Absence of antibodies against varicella zoster virus in 43.2%, Toxoplasma gondii in 26.8%, parvovirus B19 in 20.0%, and rubella virus in 15.7% makes a significant proportion of pregnant women susceptible for acquiring primary infections. Whereas all study participants had specific IgG antibodies against human cytomegalovirus, infections with Listeria, Brucella, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae as well as active syphilis were absent. Our pilot study in a rural community in Ghana indicates an urgent need for action in dealing at least with high-prevalent pregnancy-relevant infections, such as hepatitis B, malaria and those caused by group B streptococci.

Only 50% of males compared to 43% of females had ever used a condom and fewer than 8.3% of female youth used other contraceptive methods. 27.1% of pregnancies were unplanned and 60% of abortions were induced. 42.0% of female youth had received gifts/money for sexual favours. The HIV prevalence was 15.3% and 7.5% for females and males respectively. The prevalence of other STIs was relatively low. Among male youth, use of alcohol or illicit drugs was associated with increased risk of HIV infection. However, the age of sexual initiation, number of sexual partners or the age of the first sexual partner were not associated with increased risk of being HIV infected. Most female youth seen at the STI clinic had their first sexual intercourse with older males. Youth were engaging in high risk unprotected sexual practices which were predisposing them to STIs and unplanned pregnancies. There is a great need to establish more youth-friendly reproductive health clinics, encourage consistent and correct use of condoms, delay in sexual debut and avoid older sexual partners in females.",2008,Nov,BMC infectious diseases,8,,159,,10.1186/1471-2334-8-159,19019224,#1621,Urassa 2008,Exclusion reason: 7.

"Trichomonas vaginalis Incidence Associated with Hormonal Contraceptive Use and HIV Infection among Women in Rakai, Uganda.",Brahmbhatt H.; Musoke R.; Makumbi F.; Kigozi G.; Serwadda D.; Wawer M.; Gray R.,"Background. Data on the incidence of Trichomonas vaginalis and use of hormonal contraception (HC) are limited. Methods. 2,374 sexually active women aged 15-49 years from cohort surveys in Rakai, Uganda, were included. Incidence of T. vaginalis was estimated per 100 person years (py) and association between HC (DMPA, Norplant, and oral contraceptives) and T. vaginalis infection was assessed by incidence rate ratios (IRR), using Poisson regression models. Results. At baseline, 34.9% had used HC in the last 12 months, 12.8% HIV+, 39.7% with high BV-scores (7-10), and 3.1% syphilis positive. The 12-month incidence of T. vaginalis was 2.4/100 py; CI (1.90, 3.25). When stratified by type of HC used, compared to women who did not use HC or condoms, incidence of T. vaginalis was significantly higher among users of Norplant (adj.IRR = 3.01, CI: 1.07-8.49) and significantly lower among DMPA users (adj.IRR = 0.55, CI: 0.30, 0.98) and women who discontinued HC use at follow-up (adj.IRR = 0.30, CI: 0.09, 0.99). HIV infection was associated with an increase in incidence of T. vaginalis (adj.IRR = 2.34, CI: 1.44, 3.78). Conclusions. Use of Norplant and being HIV+ significantly increased the risk of T. vaginalis, while use of DMPA and discontinuation of overall HC use were associated with a decreased incidence of T. vaginalis.",2014,,Journal of sexually transmitted diseases,2014,,916597,,10.1155/2014/916597,26316977,#565,Brahmbhatt 2014,Exclusion reason: 3.

"Human Immunodeficiency Virus Seroconversion and Associated Risk Factors among Pregnant Women Delivering at Bugando Medical Center in Mwanza, Tanzania.",Mbena H.; Seni J.; Kajura A.; Matovelo D.; Kihunrwa A.,"Routine testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among pregnant women is done early during antenatal care (ANC) in Tanzania, but retesting for the women found negative is rarely done at term or during delivery. This study aimed at determining the magnitude and risk factors associated with HIV seroconversion among pregnant women delivering at Bugando Medical Center (BMC). This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2013 involving 400 pregnant women who tested HIV negative during ANC. These were re-tested during delivery, and those found positive (and their babies) were given antiretroviral therapy (ART) prophylaxis. All exposed babies were tested by polymerase chain reactions (DNAPCR) at 1 month of age. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected using a structured questionnaire and patients' files. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 software. Of 400 pregnant women (mean age 26.4 [5.73] years) enrolled, HIV seroconversion was found in 5.3% (21/400). Upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, polygamous marriage (P < 0.001) and history of syphilis during ANC visit (P < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of HIV seroconversion among pregnant women delivering at BMC. One of the 21 babies (4.8%) born of HIV seroconverted women was confirmed to be HIV infected. The high rate of HIV seroconversion found in this study implies that HIV re-testing should be an enduring exercise. This will allow timely provision of ART prophylaxis to HIV seroconverted women and their exposed babies and thus, prevent mother to child transmission of HIV.",2014,Sep,Annals of medical and health sciences research,4,5,733-7,,10.4103/2141-9248.141539,25328784,#536,Mbena 2014,Exclusion reason: 3.

Intravaginal Practices and Prevalence of Sexual and Reproductive Tract Infections Among Women in Rural Malawi.,Esber A.; Rao N.; Norris A.; Carr Reese P.; Kandodo J.; Nampandeni P.; Jumbe E.; Norris Turner A.,"Many women engage in intravaginal practices (IVP) with a goal of improving genital hygiene and increasing sexual pleasure. Intravaginal practices can disrupt the genital mucosa, and some studies have found that IVP increases risk of acquisition of HIV and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Limited prior research also suggests significant associations between IVP, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). We examined associations between IVP and HPV, BV, and HSV-2 among 200 women in rural Malawi participating in a clinic-based study on sexual and reproductive tract infections. We calculated prevalence ratios for the associations between frequency and type of IVP and outcomes of HPV, BV, and HSV-2. Intravaginal practices were commonly performed, with 95% of women reporting current use of at least 1 practice. Infections were also frequently detected: Twenty-two percent of the sample had at least 1 high-risk HPV type, 51% had BV, and 50% were HSV-2 seropositive. We observed no significant associations between type of IVP, frequency of IVP, or a combined measure capturing type and frequency of IVP-and any of the infection outcomes. Although both IVP and our outcomes of interest (BV, HPV, and HSV-2) were common in the study population, we did not detect associations between IVP type or frequency and any of the 3 infections. However, the high prevalence and frequency of IVP may have limited our ability to detect significant associations.",2016,12,Sexually transmitted diseases,43,12,750-755,,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000531,27835627,#548,Esber 2016,Exclusion reason: 5.

Poor socioeconomic status, inadequate knowledge, lack of diagnostic facilities, and shortages of effective treatment all contribute to the high incidence of STIs. The use of clinical algorithms for the detection and management of STIs has gained widespread acceptance in settings where there are limited resources. Evaluation of these algorithms have been few, especially in women who are not recognized as members of high-risk groups. To develop a simple scoring system based on historical and demographic data, physical findings, microscopy, and leukocyte esterase (LE) urine dipsticks to predict cervical gonococcal and chlamydial infection among asymptomatic women. One thousand and forty-eight women attending an urban family planning clinic in Nairobi were randomly selected to participate. After the identification of factors that were associated with infection, we assigned one point each for: age 25 or younger, single status, two or more sex partners in the past year, cervical discharge, cervical swab leukocytes, and a positive LE urine dipstick. Identification of any one of these six factors gave a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 30% for the detection of cervical infections. A positive LE urine dipstick had a sensitivity of 63 % and a specificity of 47% when used alone and did not contribute to the identification of infection if a physical examination was performed. The application of existing clinical algorithms to this population performed poorly. The use of risk scores, physical examination, microscopy, and the urine LE dipstick, used alone or in combination, as predictors of gonococcal or chlamydial cervical infection was of limited utility in low-risk, asymptomatic women.

Women were studied at a family planning clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. Demographic and historical information was obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire and specimens were collected for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HPV, cervical cytology, and HIV-1 testing. HPV was detected in 87 of 513 women (17%), including 81 (93%) oncogenic types (16, 18, 31, 33 and others) and six (7%) non-oncogenic types (6 and 11). HIV-1 prevalence was 10%.

"Factors associated with Ano-genital warts occurrence among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients in Gauteng, South Africa",Sibanda Q.; Musenge E.; Nyasulu P.; Muzah B.,"Background: The study highlighted factors associated with the occurrence of ano-genital warts (AGWs) among HIV infected individuals in South Africa (SA). Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection occurs more frequently among HIV infected individuals because of their compromised immuno-status. Methods & Materials: We conducted a secondary analysis of routine clinical data from Ward 21 clinic in Hillbrow, Johannesburg. Ward 21 is one of the largest non-hospital ART initiation sites in the world and sees over 4000 patients monthly. Participants were patients =16 years who attended the ART clinic between 2009 and 2011. Bivariate analysis was done using Chi-Squared test. Logistic regression was conducted to assess factors associated with AGWs. Analysis was stratified by gender since it showed to be an effect modifier and we assessed the following factors: sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 and scabies), age, first CD4, employment-status and ART-status. Results: AGWS prevalence was 4% and 3% among females and males respectively. The adjusted-odds of having AGWs among females above 25 years but below 55 ranged from 1.6 -18.3. A CD4 count of < 200 cells/ml3 was associated with AGWs (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.72) amongst females. Among males the adjusted-odds of having AGWs if a patient was not on ART was 1.53 ;(95% CI: 1.01 - 2.31). Conclusion: AGWs were prevalent among younger age-groups indicating young people especially females are still getting exposed to HIV and STIs in their teenage years. More need to be done to reduce STIs in order to fulfil the SA government's strategic objective of reducing STIs. Age was strongly associated with AGWs among females. Recurrent AGWs have been found to be associated with older age however we could not establish if these were recurrent. ART-status was strongly associated with AGWs among males. This confirms that though the role out of ART in SA has increased in coverage a meaningful impact on AGWs is yet to be seen.

A questionnaire and a blood sample were collected among 1228 consecutive pregnant women seen at the prenatal clinics of the two major hospitals of the district. Overall, prevalence of HIV and of serologically confirmed syphilis were 14.9% and 0.7%, respectively. HIV infection was more prevalent among the Krobo ethnic group (137 of 742 [18.5%]) than among other ethnic groups (46 of 486 [9.5%]; p <.001). Two distinct patterns of HIV distribution were identified. Among the Krobos, HIV was common among all age groups, reached a plateau (21.9%) in the 30- to 34-year-old group and was associated strongly with having lived in Côte d'Ivoire and with having received only primary school education. Among the other ethnic groups, prevalence decreased with age, from 17.2% in the 13- to 19-year-old age group to 1.4% among women aged 35 years or older, and HIV infection was associated with having had first sexual intercourse before the age of 17 years. In logistic regression analysis, the independent risk factors for HIV infection were age, schooling, age at first sexual intercourse; having lived in Côte d'Ivoire; age and schooling showed significant interactions with ethnic group. The high HIV prevalence documented in this part of Ghana seems to be, to some extent, a consequence of construction of the Akosombo dam in the 1960s. The flooding of the land, the failures of the resettlement program and the ensuing poverty prompted economically driven migration, specially to Côte d'Ivoire, where many migrants became infected with HIV. Local transmission followed.

Self-esteem and STI/HIV prevalence among residents of a Tanzanian sugar plantation,Rice C.; Turner A.N.; Norris A.; Mtweve S.,"Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, lead to significant reproductive morbidities worldwide. The association between risky sexual behaviours and increased STI/ HIV prevalence has been well-documented. In addition, low selfesteem appears to lead to higher-risk sexual behaviours. However, the direct association between self-esteem and STI/HIV has not been well studied. We aimed to examine whether self-esteem directly affects STI/HIV prevalence, after adjusting for risky sexual behaviour. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study of sugar plantation residents in Tanzania. The 2004 study included a self-administered survey with self-esteem assessment and testing for syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and HIV. We restricted our analysis to individuals with valid STI/HIV results and complete self-esteem data. Through principal component analysis, the 8-item self-esteem scale was reduced to a single variable. This variable was further categorised as low, medium, and high self-esteem and was the primary exposure variable in a multivariable log binomial model with a combined outcome representing any prevalent STI/HIV (syphilis, HSV-2, or HIV). Results: From the full study sample of 556 residents, 431 (78%) individuals had both complete STI/HIV data and self-esteem assessment and were included in the analysis. The analysis population was 51% male and 49% female. Nearly 60% (n=254) had at least one STI/HIV. We observed no significant heterogeneity by gender in the effect of self-esteem on STI/HIV prevalence. Gender, transactional sex and alcohol use were retained as confounders in the final model; no other demographic or behavioural variables met our a priori statistical criteria for confounding. The adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) for STI/HIV for individuals with low self-esteem compared to those with medium self-esteem and high self-esteem were 0.95 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.13) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.27), respectively. Conclusion Self-esteem was not independently associated with STI/ HIV prevalence in plantation residents in Tanzania. Our findings suggest that the role of self-esteem in reproductive health may be limited to its association with increased sexual risk behaviour, which subsequently affects STI/HIV prevalence. Interventions aimed at improving self-esteem may only be appropriate if they reduce likelihood of participation in risky behaviours.",2011,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,87,"(Mtweve S.)

Prevalence- and gender-specific immune response to opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients in Lesotho.,Rabenau HF.; Lennemann T.; Kircher C.; Gürtler L.; Staszewski S.; Preiser W.; McPherson P.; Allwinn R.; Doerr HW.,"The objective of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of coinfecting viruses and Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) in a cohort of 205 antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected individuals (152 females and 53 males, aged: 19-71 years) in rural Lesotho. Furthermore agent-specific immune responses were investigated by analyzing antibody titers against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and against T. pallidum. Serum samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies against HSV-2, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, and T. pallidum. Seroprevalences (95% confidence intervals) were found to be 100% (98.5%-100%) for anti-cytomegalovirus, 98.5% (95.7%-99.7%) for anti-hepatitis A virus, 35.5% (28.9%-42.6%) for anti-HBc, 5.5% (2.8%-9.6%) for hepatitis B surface antigen, and 0.5% (0.0%-2.8%) for anti-hepatitis C virus. Only 78.5% (72.2%-84.0%) were anti-HSV-2 positive and 29.0% (22.8%-35.8%) had antibodies against T. pallidum. Only anti-HSV-2 titers showed gender- and CD4 cell-count dependent differences: females with >500 CD4 cells/microL had an average anti-HSV-2 titer of 446 compared with males of 398 AU/mL (not significant), but in those with 250 to 500 CD4 cells/microL, there was a significant difference with a mean titer of 467 compared to 302 AU/mL in males (P = 0.001).

Male partner circumcision associated with lower Trichomonas vaginalis incidence among pregnant and postpartum Kenyan women: a prospective cohort study.,Pintye J.; Drake AL.; Unger JA.; Matemo D.; Kinuthia J.; McClelland RS.; John-Stewart G.,"Trichomonas vaginalis is the world's most common curable STI and has implications for reproductive health in women. We determined incidence and correlates of T. vaginalis in an HIV-uninfected peripartum cohort. Women participating in a prospective study of peripartum HIV acquisition in Western Kenya were enrolled during pregnancy and followed until 9 months post partum. T. vaginalis was assessed every 1-3 months using wet mount microscopy. Correlates of incident T. vaginalis were determined using Cox proportional hazards models. Among 1271 women enrolled, median age was 22 years (IQR 19-27) and gestational age was 22 weeks (IQR 18-26); most (78%) were married and had uncircumcised male partners (69%). Prevalent T. vaginalis was detected in 81 women (6%) at enrolment. Among women without T. vaginalis at enrolment, 112 had T. vaginalis detected during 1079 person-years of follow-up (10.4 per 100 person-years). After adjustment for socio-economic factors, male partner circumcision status, pregnancy status and other STIs, T. vaginalis incidence was higher during pregnancy than post partum (22.3 vs 7.7 per 100 person-years, adjusted HR (aHR) 3.68, 95% CI 1.90 to 7.15, p<0.001).

A Risk Assessment Tool for Identifying Pregnant and Postpartum Women Who May Benefit From Preexposure Prophylaxis.,Pintye J.; Drake AL.; Kinuthia J.; Unger JA.; Matemo D.; Heffron RA.; Barnabas RV.; Kohler P.; McClelland RS.; John-Stewart G.,"A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk assessment tool for pregnant women could identify women who would most benefit from preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) while minimizing unnecessary PrEP exposure. Data from a prospective study of incident HIV among pregnant/postpartum women in Kenya were randomly divided into derivation (n = 654) and validation (n = 650) cohorts. A risk score was derived using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and standard clinical prediction rules. Ability of the tool to predict maternal HIV acquisition was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and Brier score. The final risk score included the following predictors: having a male partner with unknown HIV status, number of lifetime sexual partners, syphilis, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and vaginal candidiasis. In the derivation cohort, AUC was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], .72-.95) and each point increment in score was associated with a 52% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52 [95% CI, 1.32-1.76]; P < .001) increase in HIV risk; the Brier score was 0.11. In the validation cohort, the score had similar AUC, Brier score, and estimated HRs. A simplified score that excluded BV and candidiasis yielded an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI, .67-.85); HIV incidence was higher among women with risk scores >6 than with scores ≤6 (7.3 vs 1.1 per 100 person-years, respectively; P < .001).

One third of patients had genital ulcers and two thirds discharges. There was good response to treatment in 461/508 patients (90.7%). Herpes simplex virus type 2 was found in 95/217 (43.8%) genital ulcers. In 24.1% of ulcer cases there was also a genital discharge. HIV seropositivity was high in ulcer cases (63.2%), with significantly more HSV2 and secondary bacterial infection than in seronegative cases.

In Gabon, data on infectious diseases of pregnant women such as syphilis and rubella are either scarce or very old. Few studies have assessed T. gondii infection during pregnancy in the country. Here, we evaluate seroprevalence of HIV, HTVL-1, syphilis and T. gondii and rubella infection during antenatal care among women living in Franceville, Gabon. A retrospective study was conducted on data collected from May 2007 to July 2010. After signing an informed written consent form, all pregnant women consulting in two hospitals of Franceville (Gabon) and in offices of maternity and childbirth health centers were included.

STD rates were also adjusted for the sensitivities and specificities of the diagnostic techniques used. Demographic patterns were similar across populations, apart from effects of AIDS on fertility and mortality (including widowhood) in Uganda. Higher sexual risk behaviours, including younger age of sexual debut, higher numbers of recent partners and lower frequency of condom use, were apparent in Mwanza compared to Masaka and Rakai.

"Transactional sexual relationships, sexually transmitted infection risk, and condom use among young Black Women in peri-urban areas of the Western Cape Province of South Africa.",Onoya D.; Reddy P.; Sifunda S.; Lang D.; Wingood GM.; van den Borne B.; Ruiter RA.,"Transactional sexual behavior has been demonstrated as an important factor underlying the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between having a history of transactional sexual relationships with condom use and STI risk. Participants completed a behavioral questionnaire in isiXhosa and provided self-collected vaginal swabs which were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare condom use rates and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among women with a history of transactional sexual relationships to women with a history of casual sexual relationships and those with no history of casual sexual relationships. Of the 446 respondents, 223 (50%) reported no history of casual sexual relationships, 94 (23.32%) indicated a history of casual sexual relationships, and among these 119 (26.68%) reported a history of transactional sexual relationships with casual partners. Participants with a history of transactional sexual relationships had a higher rate of condom use with a main partner and a lower prevalence of Chlamydia infection than participants with a history of casual relationships. Participants with a history of transactional sexual relationships were also less likely to have had a STI in the past compared with those who indicated no history of casual relationships.

"High prevalence and incidence of sexually transmitted infections among women living in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.",Naidoo S.; Wand H.; Abbai NS.; Ramjee G.,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) contribute largely to the burden of health in South Africa and are recognized as major contributors to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. Young women are particularly vulnerable to STIs. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to examine the risk factors associated with prevalent and incident STIs among women who had participated in three clinical trials. A total of 5,748 women were screened and 2293 sexually active, HIV negative, non-pregnant women were enrolled in three clinical trials in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. The prevalence of individual STIs Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), syphilis, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) was assessed at screening; and incident infections were evaluated over a 24 month period. Overall, the combined study population of all three trials had a median age of 28 years (inter-quartile range (IQR):22-37), and a median duration of follow-up of 12 months. Prevalence of STIs (CT, NG, TV, or syphilis) was 13% at screening. The STI incidence was estimated to be 20/100 women years. Younger women (<25 years, p < 0.001), women who were unmarried (p < 0.001) and non-cohabiting women (p < 0.001) were shown to be at highest risk for incident STIs. These results confirm the extremely high prevalence and incidence of STIs among women living in rural and urban communities of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the HIV epidemic is also particularly severe. These findings strongly suggest an urgent need to allocate resources for STI and HIV prevention that mainly target younger women.

Associations between psychosocial factors and incidence of sexually transmitted disease among South African adolescents.,O'Leary A.; Jemmott JB.; Jemmott LS.; Teitelman A.; Heeren GA.; Ngwane Z.; Icard LD.; Lewis DA.,"Adolescents living in South Africa are at high risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The present study sought to identify correlates of curable STD incidence among a cohort of adolescents in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Data were collected in conjunction with an HIV/STD prevention intervention randomized controlled trial. At 54 months postintervention, curable STD incidence (gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and trichomoniasis) was assayed and self-report measures of potential correlates of STD incidence were collected. Participants were adolescents reporting at least 1 sexual partner in the past 3 months (n = 659). As expected, univariate analyses revealed that girls were more likely than boys to have an STD. In addition, intimate partner violence, unprotected sex, and having older partners were associated with incident STD. In Poisson multiple regression analyses, sex (risk ratio [RR], 4.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.51-6.39), intimate partner violence (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12-1.35), unprotected sex (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-2.01), and multiple partners (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11-2.61), but not partner's age (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.94-1.07) were associated with incident STD, adjusting for 42-month STD prevalence.

Recent in vitro data suggest that interleukin (IL)-10 may increase susceptibility of macrophages to HIV-1 infection. Therefore, we performed this study to assess whether non-ulcerative STD are associated with detection of IL-10 in the female genital tract. Methods: Women with clinical pelvic inflammatory disease with or without cervicovaginal discharge were recruited from an STD clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. Endocervical and endometrial specimens were obtained for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis DNA detection, Trichonomas vaginalis culture, and CD4 and CD8 T-cell enumeration. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed by Gram stain. IL-10 was detected in endocervical specimens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood was obtained for HIV-1 serology. Results: One hundred and seventy-two women were studied.

Risk factors for men included sex under the influence of alcohol OR=7.11 (95% CI 2.42-20.85), relationships less than one year, OR=9.33 (95% CI 3.53-24.70), no condom use at first intercourse OR=5.17 (95% CI 1.64-16.25) and paying for sex OR=23.65 (95% CI 6.23-89.69). For females the risk factors were non-use of condom at first intercourse OR=2.49 (95% CI 1.02-6.04) and relationships less than one year OR=3.19 (95% CI 1.41-7.23). Significant differences in attitudes were evident among cases and controls. Conclusion: Knowledge of STI did not provide protection from STI diagnosis.

Ecological and individual level analysis of risk factors for HIV infection in four urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa with different levels of HIV infection,Auvert B.; Buvé A.; Ferry B.; Caraël M.; Morison L.; Lagarde E.; Robinson N.J.; Kahindo M.; Chege J.; Rutenberg N.; Musonda R.; Laourou M.; Akam E.,"Objective: To identify factors that could explain differences in rate of spread of HIV between different regions in sub-Saharan Africa. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The study took place in two cities with a relatively low HIV prevalence (Cotonou, Benin and Yaoundé, Cameroon), and two cities with a high HIV prevalence (Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia). In each of these cities, a representative sample was taken of about 1000 men and 1000 women aged 15-49 years. Consenting men and women were interviewed about their socio-demographic background and sexual behaviour; and were tested for HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea infection, and (women only) Trichomonas vaginalis. Analysis of risk factors for HIV infection was carried out for each city and each sex separately. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were obtained by multivariate logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of HIV infection in sexually active men was 3.9% in Cotonou, 4.4% in Yaoundé, 21.1 % in Kisumu, and 25.4% in Ndola. For women, the corresponding figures were 4.0, 8.4, 31.6 and 35.1%. High-risk sexual behaviour was not more common in the high HIV prevalence cities than in the low HIV prevalence cities, but HSV-2 infection and lack of circumcision were consistently more prevalent in the high HIV prevalence cities than in the low HIV prevalence cities. In multivariate analysis, the association between HIV infection and sexual behavioural factors was variable across the four cities. Syphilis was associated with HIV infection in Ndola in men [aOR = 2.7, 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 1.5-4.9] and in women (aOR = 1.7, 95% Cl = 1.1-2.6). HSV-2 infection was strongly associated with HIV infection in all four cities and in both sexes (aOR ranging between 4.4 and 8.0). Circumcision had a strong protective effect against the acquisition of HIV by men in Kisumu (aOR = 0.25, 95% Cl = 0.12-0.52). In Ndola, no association was found between circumcision and HIV infection but sample sizes were too small to fully adjust for confounding. Conclusion: The strong association between HIV and HSV-2 and male circumcision, and the distribution of the risk factors, led us to conclude that differences in efficiency of HIV transmission as mediated by biological factors outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the variation in rate of spread of HIV between the four cities. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2001,,AIDS,15,SUPPL. 4,S15-S30,,10.1097/00002030-200108004-00003,,#2120,Auvert 2001,Exclusion reason: 4.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection in HIV-1-infected women taking antiretroviral therapy: A prospective cohort study from Burkina Faso,Low A.J.; Konate I.; Nagot N.; Weiss H.A.; Mabey D.; Segondy M.; Vickerman P.; Meda N.; De Perre P.V.; Mayaud P.,"Objectives: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) are common sexually transmitted infections (STI). We assessed the cumulative risk of NG and CT in a cohort of HIV-1-infected high-risk women taking antiretrovirals over 4 years in Burkina Faso. Methods: Between March 2007 and February 2011, participants were followed every 3-6 months. At each visit, participants underwent a gynaecological examination with collection of cervical and vaginal swabs. Random-effects logistic regression models were used to analyse associations of NG and CT infection with behavioural and biological factors.Results: 172 women had samples tested for NG and CT during the study period, in a total of 1135 visits. NG was detected in 6.4% of women (11/172, 95% CI 2.7 to 10.1) at a rate of 2.76 cases (95% CI 1.53 to 4.99) per 100 person-years. CT was detected in 1.7% (3/172, 95% CI 0 to 3.7) of women at a rate of 0.75 cases (95% CI 0.24 to 2.34) per 100 person-years. The majority of women were asymptomatic (9/14). In the multivariable model, the presence of NG or CT was associated with tobacco use (aOR=11.85, 95% CI 1.13 to 124.17), and concurrent genital HIV-1 RNA shedding (aOR=4.78, 95% CI 1.17 to 19.46). Higher levels of education (aOR=0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.92), and age greater than 35 years (aOR=0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.92) were associated with lower odds of infection. Conclusions: The risk of NG or CT infection remains low among high-risk women in Bobo-Dioulasso. This provides some evidence that antiretroviral use does not contribute to behavioural disinhibition. The asymptomatic nature of most infections underscores the need for regular screening and treatment of STIs in core groups.",2014,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,90,2,100-103,,10.1136/sextrans-2013-051233,,#4267,Low 2014,Exclusion reason: 3.

"Common causes of vaginal infections and antibiotic susceptibility of aerobic bacterial isolates in women of reproductive age attending at Felegehiwot referral Hospital, Ethiopia: A cross sectional study",Mulu W.; Yimer M.; Zenebe Y.; Abera B.,"Background: Bacterial vaginosis, candidal, trichomonal and Gonococcal vaginal infections are a major health problems associated with gynecologic complications and increase in replication, shedding and transmission of HIV and other STIs in women of reproductive age. The study aimed at determining the prevalence of common vaginal infections and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of aerobic bacterial isolates in women of reproductive age, attending Felegehiwot referral Hospital. Methods: A hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from May to November, 2013. Simple random sampling technique was used. Demographic variables were collected using a structured questionnaire. Clinical data were collected by physicians. Two vaginal swab specimens were collected from each participant. Wet mount and Gram staining were carried out to identify motile T.vaginalis, budding yeast and clue cells. All vaginal specimens were cultured for aerobic bacterial isolates using standard microbiology methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed using disc diffusion technique as per the standard by Kirby-Bauer method. The results were analyzed using descriptive, chi-square and fisher's exact test as appropriate. Results: A total of 409 women in reproductive age (15 - 49 years) participated in the study. The median age of the women was 28 years. Overall, 63 (15.4 %) of women had vaginal infections. The proportion of vaginal infection was higher in non-pregnant (17.3 %) than pregnant women (13.3 %) (P = 0.002). The most common identified vaginal infections were candidiasis (8.3 %) and bacterial vaginosis (2.8 %) followed by trichomoniasis (2.1 %). The isolation rate of N. gonorrhoeae and group B Streptococcus colonization was 4 (1 %) and 6 (1.2 %), respectively. Bacterial vaginosis was higher in non-pregnant (5.6 %) than pregnant women (0.5 %) (P = 0.002). Religion, age, living in rural area and having lower abdominal pain were significantly associated with bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis (P < 0.05). E.coli, Pseudomonas spp. and S.aureus were frequently isolated. Norfloxacin (75.6 %), ciprofloxacin (79.6 %) and gentamicin (77.6 %) revealed high level of sensitivity whereas high resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin (82.2 %), tetracycline (63.3 %) and cotrimoxazole (62.2 %). Conclusions: Bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and trichomoniasis are a common problem in women of reproductive age. Therefore, screening of vaginal infections in women of reproductive age should be implemented. Moreover, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and gentamicin are the recommended drugs for empiric therapy and prophylaxis as needed.",2015,,BMC Women's Health,15,1,,,10.1186/s12905-015-0197-y,,#4536,Mulu 2015,Exclusion reason: 6.

Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in two cities with a high HIV prevalence (Kisumu in Kenya and Ndola in Zambia) and two cities with a relatively low HIV prevalence (Cotonou in Benin and Yaoundé in Cameroon). In each of these cities, approximately 1000 men and 1000 women, aged 15-49 years, were randomly selected from the general population. Consenting men and women were interviewed and were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis (the latter for women only). In addition, a survey was conducted on a random sample of 300 sex workers in each city. The research instruments, including the questionnaires and the laboratory procedures, were standardized to permit comparison of results. Results: The numbers of men interviewed were 1021 in Cotonou, 973 in Yaoundé, 829 in Kisumu, and 720 in Ndola. The corresponding figures for women were 1095, 1116, 1060 and 1130. In Yaoundé, Kisumu and Ndola, the response rates for men were lower than for women due to failure to make contact with eligible men. The proportion of eligible women who were interviewed was 86% in Yaoundé, and 89% in Kisumu and Ndola. In Yaoundé, 76% of eligible men were interviewed, along with 82% in Kisumu and 75% in Ndola. The prevalence of HIV infection in men was 3.3% in Cotonou, 4.1% in Yaoundé, 19.8% in Kisumu and 23.2% in Ndola. For women, the respective figures were 3.4, 7.8, 30.1 and 31.9%. The prevalence of HIV infection among women aged 15-19 years was 23.0% in Kisumu and 15.4% in Ndola. Among women in Kisumu who had their sexual debut 5 years before the interview, the prevalence of HIV infection was 46%; in Ndola, it was 59%. Among sex workers, the prevalence of HIV infection was 57.5% in Cotonou, 34.4% in Yaoundé, 74.7% in Kisumu and 68.7% in Ndola. Conclusions: The HIV prevalence rates in the general population confirmed our preliminary assessment of the level of HIV infection in the four cities, which was based on estimates of HIV prevalence from sentinel surveillance among pregnant women.

"Patterns of alcohol use, problem drinking, and HIV infection among high-risk African women","Fisher, J. C.; Cook, P. A.; Sam, N. E.; Kapiga, S. H.","Objectives: To examine the relationship between patterns of alcohol use and HIV infection and to assess the association between problem drinking and the prevalence of risk factors for HIV among a sample of high-risk African women. Methods: Baseline data were collected between 2002 and 2003 during enrollment of 1050 women in a prospective cohort study designed to assess risk factors for HIV. Information about demographic and employment characteristics, sexual behaviors, and drinking patterns were obtained by interviews. The CAGE questionnaire was used to assess problem drinking. The association between measures of alcohol use and HIV/STDs and sexual behaviors were summarized using odds ratios, adjusted odds ratios (AOR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: HIV prevalence was 19.0% (95% CI, 16.6%-21.4%). Overall 73.9% of the women drank alcohol whereas 34.6% were classified as problem drinkers.

"Interleukin-7 receptor gene polymorphism at +1237 locus and its effect on susceptibility to opportunistic infections among HIV and AIDS patients in Limpopo Province, South Africa.",Samie A.; Moloro GT.; Nangammbi TC.,"Over the past decade, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated correlations between host genetics and susceptibility to diseases. However, few studies have investigated the effects of host genetics on the occurrence of opportunistic infections among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. In the present study, the frequency of the interleukin (IL)-7Rα+1237 A/G single nucleotide polymorphisms was determined in relation to opportunistic infection occurrence among HIV and AIDS patients in the Vhembe District. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic status data were collected from patients using a structured questionnaire. Genomic DNA was extracted from mouthwash samples using the QIAmp Blood Mini Kit. Genotyping of the IL-7Rα+1237 gene was conducted using a sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction method. We found that the IL-7Rα+1237 genotype distribution in our study population differed from those in European populations with a predominance of the A/G genotype. Individuals carrying the A/G genotype primarily suffered from chest pain (χ(2) = 5.016, P = 0.025), while individuals carrying the G/G genotype were protected from chest pain but had a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted disease (23 vs 16.9%); however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.435). Individuals carrying the A/A genotype were more susceptible to diarrhea (32 vs 13.6%) (P = 0.034).

Despite reporting-high-risk sexual behaviours, mainly for males (64% of males and 6% of females had more than five sexual partners in their lifetime, 16% of males and 2% of females reported having had recent casual partners), and knowing that HIV is commonly-transmitted heterosexually in Ethiopia (97% of answers being correct, both genders combined), only 17% of males and 2% of females acknowledged having had activities which had put them at risk of HIV infection. HIV prevalence was 12%, and; did not differ by gender. Of all study participants, 327 (43.5%) returned for PTC within,60 days of HIV testing. PTC attendance did not differ by age, gender, or HIV serological status. Factors independently associated with PTC attendance in males were: good knowledge of HIV infection, [odds ratio (OR) = 1.66], belief that medical follow-up improves the course of HIV infection (OR = 2.02), history of:genital-symptoms (OR = 2.83), positive syphilis serology (OR = 2.62), recent weightless (OR = 1.89), and, with a negative association, being a manual worker (OR = 0.40), and history of recent casual sexual relationships (OR = 0.35). In women, belief that HIV/AIDS can be cured (OR = 3.16), never having been married (OR = 5.02), having five or less children (OR = 2.16), having been raped (OR = 3.42), and having used health facilities in the past year (OR = 1.73) were all positively and independently associated with PTC attendance. Conclusion: Study participants reported high-risk sexual behaviours, yet had a low perception of individual risk. Men attended for PTC because of their knowledge of HIV infection, their past sexual history or their current health status. Women attended for PTC because of their plans for the future, marriage and/or children, rather than their past sexual exposure. Only in cases of rape were they willing to learn of their HIV status.",1999,Oct,Ethiopian Medical Journal,37,,55-64,WOS:000084655300005,,,#5493,Sahlu 1999,Exclusion reason: 4.

"Prevalence of genital mycoplasmas and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women in Gauteng, South Africa",Redelinghuys M.J.; Ehlers M.M.; Dreyer A.W.; Lombaard H.; Kock M.M.,"Background: Bacterial vaginosis and genital mycoplasmas are reproductive tract infections that are associated with several infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, preterm birth and spontaneous abortions in affected women. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a polymicrobial condition, is reported to be prevalent in 15% to 20% of pregnant women while mycoplasmas colonise up to about 70% of sexually active women and antenatal patients. Methods: Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained from 221 pregnant women. Bacteria vaginosis was diagnosed using the Nugent scoring system and a multiplex PCR assay was performed to detect genital mycoplasmas. Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. parvum were targeted, respectively, for the 16S rRNA gene, 140-kDa adhesion protein and the multiple-banded antigen genes. Results: The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis was 17.6% (39/221) with a total of 23.1% (9/39) of all BV-positive cases (score 7 to 10) being HIV positive. An intermediate grading according to the Nugent system (score 4 to 6) was given to 14.9% (33/221) of samples. Ureaplasma parvum was isolated from the majority of samples with a prevalence of 72.4% (160/221) followed by M. hominis, which was present in 50.7% (112/221) of all samples. The prevalence of M. genitalium and U. urealyticum was 14.5% (32/221) and 2.3% (5/221), respectively. Mycoplasma hominis was detected in 75% (27/36) of all HIV positive cases with U. parvum also present in 75% (27/36) of these cases. Conclusions: The overall prevalence of genital mycoplasmas in antenatal patients was relatively high when compared to previous studies, while BV prevalence correlated with other reports. Ureaplasma parvum and M. hominis were notably present in HIV positive patients. The diagnosis of genital mycoplasmas and BV in pregnant women in HIV-prevalent South Africa is vital to allow early intervention and minimise complications, such as undesirable pregnancy outcomes.",2013,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,89,"(Lombaard H.)

This analysis reports on completeness of patient-held infant Road to Health Booklets (RtHBs), amongst HIV exposed and unexposed infants during the first two years after the RtHB was launched country-wide in South Africa. Secondary data were analysed from two nationally representative, cross-sectional surveys, conducted in 2011-12 and 2012-13. These surveys aimed to measure early effectiveness of the national programme for preventing vertical HIV transmission. Participants were eligible for this analysis if they were 4-8 weeks old, receiving their six-week immunisation, not needing emergency care and had their RtHBs reviewed. Caregivers were interviewed and data abstracted from RtHBs. RtHB completeness across both surveys was defined as the proportion of RtHBs with any of the following indicators recorded: infant birth weight, BCG immunisation, maternal syphilis results and maternal HIV status. A partial proportional odds logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with completeness. Survey sampling weights were included in all analyses. Data from 10 415 (99.6%) participants in 2011-12 and 9529 (99.2%) in 2012-13 were analysed. Overall, recording of all four indicators increased from 23.1% (95% confidence interval (CI)  = 22.2-24.0) in 2011-12 to 43.3% (95% CI = 42.3-44.4) in 2012-13. In multivariable models, expected RtHB completeness (ie, recording all four indicators vs recording of <4 indicators), was significantly (P<0.05) associated with survey year, marital status, socio-economic status, maternal antenatal TB screening, antenatal infant feeding counselling, delivery at a clinic or hospital and type of birth attendant. Routine patient-held infant health RtHB, a critical tool for continuity of care in high HIV/TB prevalence settings, was poorly completed, with less than 50% of the RtHB showing expected completeness.

Why sti-associated genital tract inflammation still matters in HIV transmission,Passmore J.-A.,"Women in Africa, especially young women, have very high HIV incidence rates that cannot be fully explained by behavioural risks. In the setting of syndromic management for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV), the influence of these, particularly asymptomatic infections, on CD4+ T cell activation and inflammation in the genital tracts of adolescents from South Africa urgently needs to be addressed. The influence of genital inflammation on HIV acquisition in this group will be discussed. Our study found that HIV seroconversion was associated with raised genital inflammatory cytokines (including chemokines MIP-1a, MIP-1b and IP-10). The risk of HIV acquisition was significantly higher in women with evidence of genital inflammation, defined by at least 5 of 9 inflammatory cytokines being raised [OR 3.2; 95% confidence interval 1.3- 7.9]. Genital cytokine concentrations were persistently raised (for about one year before infection), with no readily identifiable cause despite extensive investigation of several potential factors, including STIs and systemic cytokines. Adolescents (median 18 years) had significantly higher frequencies of activated CD4+ Tcells (CD38+, HLADR+, CD38+HLADR+) from cervical cytobrushes than adults, although CCR5 expression was higher in adults. STIs and BV prevalence was very high in certain areas of South Africa, with 71% of adolescents having >1 STI and/or BV, and 42% being C. trachomatis positive. Adolescents with an STI had higher frequencies of activated and proliferating T-cells compared to those with no STI/BV. Higher cervical T-cell activation marker expression was directly associated with increased genital cytokine profiles. Our data suggests that elevated genital concentrations of HIV target cell-recruiting chemokines and a genital inflammatory profile contributes to the high risk of HIV acquisition in these African women. In adolescents, heightened levels of genital immune activation and inflammation, partly due to the presence of asymptomatic STIs/BV, could increase their risk for HIV infection.",2015,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,91,"(Passmore J.-A.)

Alcohol and transactional sex: how risky is the mix?,Norris AH.; Kitali AJ.; Worby E.,"This study examines alcohol use, transactional sex (TS), and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among sugar plantation residents near Moshi, Tanzania, from 2002 to 2004. We compare popular discourse gathered through ethnographic methods with cross-sectional questionnaire and STI prevalence data to illuminate the close correspondence of alcohol use and TS with STI transmission. People attributed to alcohol varied consequences: some socially desirable (relaxing, reducing worries) and others (drunkenness, removing shame) thought to put alcohol abusers at risk for STIs. TS-exchanging money, food, gifts, alcohol or work for sex-was not stigmatized, but people believed that seeking sexual partners for money (or providing money to sexual partners) led to riskier sexual relationships. We explore popular discourse about how alcohol use and TS independently and in combination led to increased STI exposure. Popular discourse blamed structural circumstances-limited economic opportunities, few social activities, separated families-for risky sex and STIs. To understand individual behavior and risk, we surveyed 556 people. We measured associations between their self-reported behaviors and infection with herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), syphilis, and HIV in 462 participants who were tested. Alcohol abuse was associated with prevalent STI and HIV infection. Exchanging sex for alcohol and work were both associated with prevalent STI. Participants who both abused alcohol and participated in TS had greatest risk for STI. Findings from the two analytic methods-interrogation of popular discourse, and association between self-reported behavior and STIs-were largely in agreement. We posit explanations for discrepancies we found through the concepts of sensationalization, self-exceptionalization, and the influence of an authoritative moral discourse.",2009,Oct,Social science & medicine (1982),69,8,1167-76,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.07.015,19713023,#808,Norris 2009,Exclusion reason: 8.

We optimised a multiassay algorithm (MAA) and assessed HIV incidence, correlates of recent infections, viral diversity, plus transmission clusters among participants screened for Kisumu Incidence Cohort Study (KICoS1) (2007-2009). We performed BED-CEIA, Limiting antigen (LAg) avidity, Biorad avidity, and viral load (VL) tests on HIV-positive samples. Genotypic analyses focused on HIV-1 pol gene. Correlates of testing recent by MAA were assessed using logistic regression model. Overall, 133 (12%, 95% CI: 10.2-14.1) participants were HIV-positive, of whom 11 tested recent by MAA (BED-CEIA OD-n < 0.8 + LAg avidity OD-n < 1.5 + VL > 1000 copies/mL), giving an incidence of 1.46% (95% CI: 0.58-2.35) per year. This MAA-based incidence was similar to longitudinal KICoS1 incidence.

It has presented public health concern because of its progressively increasing prevalence which some authorities say is of epidemic proportion in developing countries. Herpes simplex virus type 2 has recently been found to have synergistic effect with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and co-infection of the two presents more severe burden to the immunity of the victim. This leads to much morbidity and mortality with negative economic impact. In this study, we set out to determine antibody prevalence of HSV-2 in women attending skin and ante natal care [ANC] clinics in University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital [UNTH] and Enugu State University Teaching Hospital [ESUTH]. 180 female patients/clients attending skin and ANC clinics in UNTH and ESUTH were enrolled in this descriptive study. Sociodemographic data and medical history were collected using a questionnaire. They were also examined for signs of HSV 2 manifestation, other STIs and WHO staging if HIV positive. Samples were also taken for serology, Gram staining and CD4 T-lymphocyte count.

Patterns of sexually transmitted infections in patients presenting in special treatment clinic in Ibadan south western Nigeria,"Nwadike, V. U.; Olusanya, O.; Anaedobe, G. C.; Kalu, I.; Ojide, K. C.","Introduction: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are often transferred from one person to another during sexual activity. In developing countries, an increase in the incidence of STIs is attributed to increasing urbanization, modernization, travel, education and exposure to Western media which has led to increased sexual activity, especially among young people. Methods: This is a retrospective study carried out in the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, Nigeria. The records of a total of 506 patients who attended the clinic between Jan 2010-Dec 2011 were retrieved. The records of the patients' complaints were taken. Detailed demographic data and history of genital symptoms was taken. Results: The records of 506 patients were used 43.7% (221) were males and 56.3% (285) were females. The patient's age ranged from one to eighty, the 1-10 age groups and the 71-80 ages were the least represented age group. Age, sex, level of education, presenting complaints, presence of yeast cells, VDRL positivity were variables that were looked at. Of these only sex and occupation were risk factors for transmission of STI. Conclusion: Good clinical care for patients with STIs should extend beyond therapy and include help to avoid future infections. Control activities should focus on the primary prevention of infection through safer sexual practices.

"Intravaginal practices, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases among South African women.",Myer L.; Denny L.; De Souza M.; Barone MA.; Wright TC.; Kuhn L.,"Intravaginal practices, including wiping, douching, or inserting substances into the vagina, have been hypothesized to increase women's risk of HIV infection. However, data on the prevalence of these practices, and associations with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD), are limited. We interviewed 2,897 women participating in a gynecologic screening study in Cape Town, South Africa, about their intravaginal practices. After clinical examination, cervical and blood samples were collected and tested for HIV and other STD [corrected].

Minimum inhibitory concentrations of metronidazole and tinidazole against trichomonas vaginalis,Mtshali A.N.; Joubert B.C.; Moodley P.; Sturm A.W.,"Introduction Syndromic management is used to control sexually transmitted diseases in South Africa. Trichomonas vaginalis causes trichomoniasis which results in vaginal discharge in symptomatic patients. This is treated with metronidazole which is included in the syndromic management antimicrobial regime. In order for this regime to be effective, the organisms causing each syndrome and their antimicrobial susceptibility profile need to be evaluated periodically to ensure that the most appropriate antimicrobial agents are included. Methods Women 18 years and older presenting with vaginal discharge were recruited from two different clinics of KwaZulu- Natal province in South Africa. Vaginal specimens were collected using a Dacron swab and cultured in modified Diamonds medium. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of T. vaginalis to metronidazole and tinidazole were determined in 94 positive clinical isolates using a micro-broth dilution method. Briefly trichomonads were added to Diamonds media containing two-fold dilutions (16 to 0.25 mg/L) of metronidazole or tinidazole and incubated anaerobically for 72 h. The lowest concentration at which no motile trichomonads were visualised under an inverted phase contrast microscope was considered the MIC. Propionibacterium acnes and Bacteroides fragilis were used as the resistant and sensitive controls respectively. MIC ≤ 1 mg/L was considered sensitive, MIC ≥4 mg/L was considered resistant; MIC between 1 mg/L and 4 mg/L was considered intermediate. The MIC of any isolate in the resistant range was repeated to confirm results. Results Of the 94 isolates, 17 had an MIC ≥4 mg/L indicating in vitro resistance to metronidazole while 2 isolates had an MIC ≥4 mg/L for tinidazole. Thirty-five and 33 isolates had an MIC of 2 mg/L (intermediate) for metronidazole and tinidazole respectively. Conclusion High MIC of T. vaginalis to metronidazole is a public health concern however more research is needed to correlate in vitro resistance with clinical failure.",2015,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,91,"(Mtshali A.N.; Joubert B.C.; Moodley P.; Sturm A.W.)

Randomized Controlled Pilot Study of Antiretrovirals and a Behavioral Intervention for Persons With Acute HIV Infection: Opportunity for Interrupting Transmission.,Miller WC.; Rutstein SE.; Phiri S.; Kamanga G.; Nsona D.; Pasquale DK.; Rucinski KB.; Chen JS.; Golin CE.; Powers KA.; Dennis AM.; Hosseinipour MC.; Eron JJ.; Chege W.; Hoffman IF.; Pettifor AE.,"Persons with acute HIV infection (AHI) have heightened transmission risk. We evaluated potential transmission reduction using behavioral and biomedical interventions in a randomized controlled pilot study in Malawi. Persons were randomized 1:2:2 to standard counseling (SC), 5-session behavioral intervention (BI), or behavioral intervention plus 12 weeks of antiretrovirals (ARVs; BIA). All were followed for 26-52 weeks and, regardless of arm, referred for treatment according to Malawi-ARV guidelines. Participants were asked to refer partners for testing. Among 46 persons (9 SC, 18 BI, 19 BIA), the average age was 28; 61% were male. The median viral load (VL) was 5.9 log copies/mL at enrollment. 67% (10/15) of BIA participants were suppressed (<1000 copies/mL) at week 12 vs 25% BI and 50% SC (P = .07). Although the mean number of reported condomless sexual acts in the past week decreased from baseline across all arms (1.5 vs 0.3 acts), 36% experienced incident sexually transmitted infection by 52 weeks (12% SC, 28% BI, 18% BIA). Forty-one percent (19/46) of participants referred partners (44% SC, 44% BI, 37% BIA); 15 of the partners were HIV-infected. Diagnosis of AHI facilitates behavioral and biomedical risk reduction strategies during a high-transmission period that begins years before people are typically identified and started on ARVs. Sexually transmitted infection incidence in this cohort suggests ongoing risk behaviors, reinforcing the importance of early intervention with ARVs to reduce transmission. Early diagnosis coupled with standard AHI counseling and early ARV referral quickly suppresses viremia, may effectively change behavior, and could have tremendous public health benefit in reducing onward transmission.",2019,Jan,Open forum infectious diseases,6,1,ofy341,,10.1093/ofid/ofy341,30648131,#1192,Miller 2019,Exclusion reason: 3.

Bacterial vaginosis and intravaginal practices: association with HIV.,Mbizvo ME.; Musya SE.; Stray-Pedersen B.; Chirenje Z.; Hussain A.,"To determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and to identify risk factors associated with this condition among urban women in Harare, Zimbabwe. A cross sectional study. Prevalent bacteria vaginosis (BV), HIV and intravaginal practices. Urban primary health care clinics in Harare. 177 pregnant and 212 non pregnant women attending mother and child health care clinics. The women were recruited, counselled, interviewed, examined and tested for reproductive tract infections including HIV. Those with reproductive tract infections were given free treatment. The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis was 36% among HIV seropositive women and 26% among those seronegative. Fifty one per cent of the women practiced intravaginal cleansing, while another 28% reported use of intravaginal herbs. Women reporting intravaginal cleansing and/or use of intravaginal herbs were more likely to have bacterial vaginosis (OR 6.2 CI 3.6 to 10.7) and (OR 1.5 CI 1.1 to 2.5) and to be HIV seropositive (OR 1.8 CI 1.2 to 2.8) and (OR 1.8 CI 1.1 to 2.9) respectively. Other factors associated with bacterial vaginosis were malodorous vaginal discharge (OR 5.8 CI 2.9 to 10.7), genital warts (OR CI 3 CI 1.1 to 10.1) and Trichomonas vaginalis (OR 25.5 CI 11.6 to 56.7). BV was shown to be a common condition among the women the majority of whom indulged in intravaginal practices. HIV infection among women with BV and those that practiced intravaginal cleansing and/or use of herbs was significantly higher.

"Prevalence and factors associated with trichomonas vaginalis infection among pregnant women attending public antenatal clinics in Mwanza City, North-Western Tanzania",Maufi A.J.; Mazigo H.D.; Kihunrwa A.,"Background: Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted parasitic infection known to cause vaginitis especially in women of child bearing age. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with T. vaginalis among pregnant women attending public health facilities in Mwanza City, Tanzania. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant women aged 17-46 years attending three public antenatal clinics in Mwanza City, north-western Tanzania. Wet preparation and Giemsa stained thick smears techniques were used to diagnose T. vaginalis infection. Socio-demographic characteristics and other risk related behaviours were collected. Results: A total of 365 pregnant women participated in this study, 38 (10.41%) and 84 (23.01%) of them had trichomoniasis based on wet preparation and Giemsa stained thick smears respectively. On multivariable analysis, being HIV seropositive (AOR=11.65, 95%CI; 1.15-117.49, P<0.03) and having other sexual transmitted disease such as syphilis (AOR=4.40, 95%CI: 1.32-14.7, P<0.01) were significantly associated with T. vaginalis. Conclusion: The prevalence of T. vaginalis in pregnant women in Mwanza city is high and the infection is associated with sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and HIV. Routine screening of T. vaginalis during ante-natal care clinics is highly recommended to reduce pregnancy complications related to T. vaginalis infection.",2016,,Tanzania Journal of Health Research,18,2,,,10.4314/thrb.v18i2.6,,#4084,Maufi 2016,Exclusion reason: 5.

"High prevalence of curable sexually transmitted infections among pregnant women in a rural county hospital in Kilifi, Kenya.",Masha SC.; Wahome E.; Vaneechoutte M.; Cools P.; Crucitti T.; Sanders EJ.,"Women attending antenatal care (ANC) in resource-limited countries are frequently screened for syphilis and HIV, but rarely for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We assessed the prevalence of curable STIs, defined as infection with either Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Trichomonas vaginalis, from July to September 2015. In a cross-sectional study, women attending ANC at the Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, had a urine sample tested for C. trachomatis/N. gonorrhoeae by GeneXpert® and a vaginal swab for T. vaginalis by culture. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was defined as a Nugent score of 7-10 of the Gram stain of a vaginal smear in combination with self-reported vaginal discharge. Genital ulcers were observed during collection of vaginal swabs. All women responded to questions on socio-demographics and sexual health and clinical symptoms of STIs. Predictors for curable STIs were assessed in multivariable logistic regression. A total of 42/202 (20.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI):15.4-27.0) women had a curable STI. The prevalence was 14.9% for C. trachomatis (95% CI:10.2-20.5), 1.0% for N. gonorrhoeae (95% CI: 0.1-3.5), 7.4% for T. vaginalis (95% CI:4.2-12.0), 19.3% for BV (95% CI: 14.1-25.4) and 2.5% for genital ulcers (95% CI: 0.8-5.7). Predictors for infection with curable STIs included women with a genital ulcer (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 35.0, 95% CI: 2.7-461.6) compared to women without a genital ulcer, women who used water for cleaning after visiting the toilet compared to those who used toilet paper or other solid means (AOR = 4.1, 95% CI:1.5-11.3), women who reported having sexual debut ≤ 17 years compared to women having sexual debut ≥18 years (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI:1.1-6.6), and BV-positive women (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI:1.1-6.6) compared to BV-negative women.

"STI among vulnerables youth attending free targeted HIV counselling and testing services including and STI diagnosis and management in Benin, West Africa",Marguerite B.N.; Amour B.A.,"Background: In collaboration with two health facilities and a mobile clinic, Counselling and Testing (CT) services was implemented in two departments of Benin (Atacora and Donga) trough a project funded by the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) Germany. These interventions targeted vulnerable youth (15-24) and included STI prevention, screening and management, using clinical screening algorithms. 28 868 clients requesting HIV counselling and testing were registered from 2007 to 2009 trough a database. Objectives To assess rate and risks factors of STI among vulnerable youth attending counselling and testing facilities, including STI management. Methods: Descriptive analysis and logistic regression was performed on the database with SPSS 17. The dependent variable is “having had an STI the last 3 months”. The independents variables are-“having multiple partners in the three past months”, “consistent use of condom” and socio-demographic characteristics. Results: In all 5.1% of HIV counselled and tested clients approached for STI on-site screening had STI the last 3 month, while STI prevalence among this population is 1.9%. Multiple partners (OR=4.5; p=0.000), no consistent use of condom (0R=1.3; p=0.002) were significantly associate to IST infection. The level of instruction (OR=1.3; p=0.000) and sex (OR=0.6; p=0.000) were the significant socio-demographic characteristic associated with STI. Conclusions: Data findings indicate that having had STI in the last 3 month may be a motivation for youth which are attending HIV counselling and testing facilities in Atacora/Donga in Benin, and “high numbers of partners” is the main risk factor for STI among them. Then, scaling up HIV counselling and testing services may be a right way for STI prevention, screening and management. Finding suggests that such intervention (counselling) focused on reducing number of partner, improved to promotion of condom use, may reduce STI incidence among vulnerable youth that need further investigation.",2011,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,87,"(Marguerite B.N.; Amour B.A.) Population Service International, Benin, Cotonou, Benin",A134-A135,,10.1136/sextrans-2011-050108.87,,#3187,Marguerite 2011,Exclusion reason: 7.

No evidence of sexual transmission of Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus in a heterosexual South African population.,Malope BI.; MacPhail P.; Mbisa G.; MacPhail C.; Stein L.; Ratshikhopha EM.; Ndhlovu L.; Sitas F.; Whitby D.,"The transmission of Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) in men who have sex with men is clearly associated with sexual risk factors, but evidence of heterosexual transmission of KSHV is conflicting. Sera were obtained from 2103 South African individuals (862 miners, 95 sex workers, 731 female and 415 male township residents; mean age 33.2 years; +/- 10.1). All sera were tested for antibodies to KSHV lytic K8.1 and latent Orf73, HIV, gonococcus, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis and chlamydia. Information on social, demographic and high-risk sexual behavior was linked to laboratory data, to evaluate risk factors, expressed as odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for KSHV. Overall KSHV and HIV prevalences were 47.5 and 40%, respectively (P = 0.43). The risk of HIV infection was highest in sex workers then female residents and miners, compared with male residents (P < 0.001). HSV-2 infection was highly prevalent (66%) and lower, but still substantial, prevalences (6-8%) were observed for other sexually transmitted infections (STI). No significant difference in KSHV infection was observed among the residential groups (P > 0.05). KSHV was not associated with any of the STI or any measures of sexual behavior (P > 0.05). The pattern of HIV and STI in sex workers suggests high rates of high-risk sexual behavior in this population.

Acquisition of Sexually Transmitted Infections among Women Using a Variety of Contraceptive Options: A prospective Study among High-risk African Women.,Kiweewa FM.; Brown E.; Mishra A.; Nair G.; Palanee-Phillips T.; Mgodi N.; Nakabiito C.; Chakhtoura N.; Hillier SL.; Baeten JM.;  .,"In many African settings, women concurrently face substantial risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. Few studies have evaluated STI risk among users of hormonal implants and copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) although these long-acting reversible contraceptive methods are being promoted widely because of their benefits. Within a prospective study of women at risk for HIV-1, we compared the risk of acquisition of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis among women using different contraceptive methods. MTN-020/ASPIRE was a randomized trial of the dapivirine vaginal ring for HIV-1 prevention among 2629 women aged 18 to 45 years from Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe, of whom 2264 used copper IUDs or progestin-based injectables or implants during follow-up.

C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae incidence were not significantly different across contraceptive methods. T. vaginalis incidence was significantly higher for copper IUD users compared to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), implant and norethisterone enanthate users. Among African women at high HIV-1 risk, STIs were common. Risk of cervical infections did not differ across contraceptive methods.

Patients completed a questionnaire, underwent a genital examination, and had specimens taken for etiologic testing. Patients were offered, but not required to accept, HIV testing using a standard HIV algorithm in which two rapid tests defined a positive result. A total of 489 participants (81.5%) accepted HIV testing; 201 (41.1%) tested HIV-1-positive, including 16 (11.9%) of 134 participants who reported an HIV-negative status at study enrollment, and 58 (28.2%) of 206 participants who reported their HIV status as unknown.

Volunteers were recruited from a rural family-planning clinic and an urban clinic for sexually transmitted infections. Consenting, HIV-uninfected women aged 14-30 years were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, sexual and behavioural data were collected using standardized questionnaires with HIV risk reduction counselling and HIV testing. Pelvic examinations were completed at quarterly visits. The HIV prevalence at screening was 35.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 32.7-38.8] amongst rural women and 59.3% (95% CI 56.5-62.0) amongst urban women. A total of 594/2240 (26.5%) enrolled women contributed to 602 person-years (PYs) of follow-up. The median age was 22 years [inter-quartile range 18-23 years]. HIV incidence rate was 6.5/100 PY (95% CI 4.4-9.2) amongst rural women and 6.4/100 PY (95% CI 2.6-13.2) amongst urban women. HIV incidence rate of 17.2/100 PY (95% CI 2.1-62.2) was highest amongst urban women <20 years of age and 10.2/100 PY (95% CI 4.1-20.9) amongst rural women ≥ 25 years of age. HIV incidence rates are devastatingly high in young women in rural and urban KwaZulu-Natal, despite reports of stabilized HIV prevalence observed in current surveillance data.

Between 2003 and 2004, 958 women at risk of STIs were enrolled in a 1-year prospective study. They were interviewed at each monthly visit, and samples for STI testing were collected during quarterly and other visits when clinically indicated. The incidence of infections as measured in person-years at risk (PYAR) was as follows: overall trichomoniasis, 31.9/100 PYAR; chlamydial infection in South Africa, 19.5/100 PYAR; chlamydial infection in Tanzania and Zambia, 4.9/100 PYAR; gonorrhea in South Africa, 16.5/100 PYAR; gonorrhea in Tanzania and Zambia, 5.3/100 PYAR; overall syphilis, 7.5/100 PYAR; and overall HIV, 3.8/100 PYAR. The incidence of most STIs was highest among the South African sites, where chlamydial infection and gonorrhea were detected by using a more sensitive assay. Independent risk factors included age, hormonal contraceptive methods, and measures of sexual behavior, including number of sex partners and occurrence of anal sex in the past 3 months. Women with incident HIV infection were at increased risk of chlamydial infection [odds ratio (OR) = 5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-15.2]and gonorrhea (OR = 5.7, 95% CI: 1.9-17.0) in South African sites.

Clinical versus laboratory screening for sexually transmitted infections prior to insertion of intrauterine contraception among women living with HIV/AIDS-a randomised controlled trial,Kakaire O.; Byamugisha J.; Tumwesigye N.; Gemzell-Danielsson K.,"Objectives: To determine if laboratory testing versus no additional testing for STI after syndromic screening reduces the rate of infectious morbidity among WLHA using IUC at Mulago Hospital, Uganda. Method: We enrolled WLHA from 2nd September to 6th December 2013 and followed until 31st December 2014. After syndromic screening, 703 women free of STIs were randomised to either additional laboratory screening or no additional screening for STI before IUC insertion. All women randomised had an IUC inserted and in all 672 participants completed the one year follow-up. The study staff that followed up the participants was blinded to the study allocation groups. Survival analysis was conducted and cox's proportional hazards ratios used to compare instantaneous risks of infectious morbidity between the two groups. Results: The rate of IUC related infectious morbidity was 10.6% (35/331) in the no additional screening group and 10.3% (35/341) in the additional laboratory screening group (hazard ratio 1.04 (95% CI 0.89-1.20). Unscheduled clinic attendances were similar in the two groups at one year of IUC insertion 13.6% (45/331) in the no additional screening group and 12.3% (42/241) in the additional laboratory screening group. During the one year after IUC insertion, only five women, three from the no additional screening group and two from the additional laboratory screening group developed PID, as defined by established criteria. Conclusions: Infectious morbidity among WLHA opting for IUC is low. Syndromic screening for STIs could be sufficient in identifying WLHA who are suitable for IUC use.

Age-specific trends in HIV-1 seroprevalence among antenatal clinic attendees in four distinct geographic areas of Mbeya region between 1988 and 2000 and in one area of Rukwa region between 1991 and 1999 were analysed and compared. In Mbeya region a comprehensive AIDS control programme has been implemented since 1988. Indicators measuring behavioural change and the attendance rate of patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were monitored through the established routine system, complemented by two Knowledge, Attitude and Practise (KAP) surveys in 1995 and 1999. Data showed an increasing HIV-1 prevalence from 1988 up to 1994/95 for women in the age group 15-24 years across all strata. Between 1994/95 and 2000 the prevalence declined significantly in all strata for this age group in Mbeya region with diverse patterns in spread of the infection accompanied by a significant decrease in the positive syphilis serology, high rate of condom use, significant delay of age for the start of sexual activity of primary school pupils and a high treatment rate for STDs. The increasing trend of the HIV-1 prevalence in Rukwa region continued.

High prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in pregnant adolescent girls in Tanzania: a multi-community cross-sectional study.,Hokororo A.; Kihunrwa A.; Hoekstra P.; Kalluvya SE.; Changalucha JM.; Fitzgerald DW.; Downs JA.,"Limited data document sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among pregnant adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, where prenatal screening typically includes only HIV and syphilis. Given that HIV incidence in this population is among the world's highest, we sought to assess the prevalence and factors associated with STIs in a population of rural pregnant adolescents in Tanzania. We enrolled 403 pregnant adolescent girls from 10 antenatal clinics near Mwanza, Tanzania. Girls answered structured interviews about sexual health and risk factors and were tested for six common STIs. 199 girls (49.4%) had at least one STI. Herpes Simplex Virus- Type 2 was most prevalent (139 girls, 34.5%), followed by trichomoniasis (54 girls, 13.4%), chlamydia (46 girls, 11.4%), gonorrhoea (27 girls, 6.7%), syphilis (21 girls, 5.2%) and HIV (30 girls, 4.7%). Of note, 53/199 (26.6%) of girls with laboratory-proven STIs were asymptomatic. On multivariable analysis, the presence of any STI was associated with being in a long-term (as opposed to short-term) relationship (OR=2.6 (1.4 to 4.9) p=0.004), younger age at first sexual debut (OR=0.9 per year (0.8 to 0.99), p=0.034), increasing age difference between the girl and her partner (OR=1.1 (1.0 to 1.1) per year, p=0.03) and history of prior pregnancy (OR=1.6 (1.0 to 2.6), p=0.04). STIs affected half of rural pregnant adolescents in Tanzania.

Effectiveness of cellulose sulfate vaginal gel for the prevention of HIV infection: results of a Phase III trial in Nigeria.,Halpern V.; Ogunsola F.; Obunge O.; Wang CH.; Onyejepu N.; Oduyebo O.; Taylor D.; McNeil L.; Mehta N.; Umo-Otong J.; Otusanya S.; Crucitti T.; Abdellati S.,"This trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of 6% cellulose sulfate vaginal gel in preventing male-to-female vaginal transmission of HIV, gonorrhea and chlamydial infection. This Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between November 2004 and March 2007 in Lagos and Port Harcourt, Nigeria. We enrolled 1644 HIV-antibody negative women at high risk of HIV acquisition. Study participants were randomized 1:1 to cellulose sulfate or placebo and asked to use gel plus a condom for each act of vaginal intercourse over one year of follow-up. The participants were evaluated monthly for HIV, gonorrhea and chlamydial infection, and for adverse events. The trial was stopped prematurely after the data safety monitoring board of a parallel trial concluded that cellulose sulfate might be increasing the risk of HIV. In contrast, we observed fewer infections in the active arm (10) than on placebo (13), a difference that was nonetheless not statistically significant (HR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.3-1.8; p = 0.56). Rates of gonorrhea and chlamydial infection were lower in the CS group but the difference was likewise not statistically significant (HR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.1; p = 0.19 for the combined STI outcome). Rates of adverse events were similar across study arms. No serious adverse events related to cellulose sulfate use were reported. Cellulose sulfate gel appeared to be safe in the evaluated study population but we found insufficient evidence that it prevented male-to-female vaginal transmission of HIV, gonorrhea or chlamydial infection.

"Assessing therapeutic management of vaginal and urethral symptoms in an anonymous HIV testing centre in Luanda, Angola",Guimarães H.; Castro R.; Tavira L.T.; Exposto F.L.,"Introduction: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections and to assess the therapeutic management of vaginal/urethral discharge and dysuria in patients with human immunodeficiency virus in Luanda, Angola, taking into account World Health Organization recommendations for sexually transmitted infection syndromic management. Methodology: Socio-demographic and medical data were obtained from 436 individuals, and clinical examinations were performed in 104 women and 8 men. Vaginal/cervical and urethral specimens were collected from 112 individuals for observation of Trichomonas vaginalis, yeasts and bacterial vaginosis, while urine samples were obtained from 415 patients (221 symptomatic and 194 asymptomatic). Diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis was performed by polymerase chain reaction assay. Results: The prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis was 8.4% (35/415) and 7.9%, (33/415) respectively. Eight of the 35 N. gonorrhoeae positive cases were treated. All men and women (79) who presented a positive wet mount/Gram stain were etiologically treated according to microscopy results. In contrast, 53.3% of the female patients (16/30) and 33.3% (1/3) of the male patients who presented microscopy negative results were treated for urinary tract infection or by syndromic approach. Among non-examined patients, 15% of women (12/80) and 52.5% of men (21/40) were treated without an etiological result. Syndromic treatment was preferentially given to non-examined males (19/40-47.5%) over females (12/80-15%) (p<0.01).

Opportunities for treating sexually transmitted infections and reducing HIV risk in rural South Africa.,Frohlich JA.; Abdool Karim Q.; Mashego MM.; Sturm AW.; Abdool Karim SS.,"This paper is a report of a study to determine the aetiological distribution of sexually transmitted infections and prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection in selected primary health care clinic attendees. South Africa has a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections. Sexually transmitted infections are managed syndromically in the public sector as part of the essential nurse-driven primary care services provided at no cost to the client. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural community in South Africa between September and November 2002. A total of 277 consenting women were recruited. Vulvo-vaginal swabs were collected for screening for Neisseriae gonorrheae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis using DNA amplification methods and Gram stain with Nugent's score for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Seroprevalence of syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were determined.

Diagnosis of Molluscum Contagiosum infection was based on the clinical findings of typical lesions on the external genitalia, perianal, trunk, abdominal and facial regions. Results: The mean age of the patients was 34.67 yrs. ± 9.16). About 10% (542) had various sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The male to female ratio was 1: 4.2. One hundred and twenty seven subjects (23.4%) had no formal or primary education with 247 (45.6 %) beingtreatment naïve while 295 (54.4 %) were treatment experienced. Of the 542 PLWHAs with STIs, 3.3 % had undetectable viral load (&amp;lt; 200 copies/ ml) while 272 (50.1 %) had low CD4 count (&amp;lt; 200 cells / mm3.) and The Mean log10 viral load was 5.02 + 0.94. Molluscum Contagiosum infection was diagnosed in 13 patients (0.024%; 8 females and 5 males). Vaginal Candidiasis was the commonest genital infection diagnosed in 223 (41.1%) of the patients with STIs. MC patients had higher viral load, lower CD4 count and more likely to be treatment experienced”.Conclusions: Molluscum Contagiosum infection is not uncommon among the HIV-infected patients, but underreported.

Sexually Transmitted Diseases seen in a Nigerian tertiary institution,Fatiregun A.A.; Afolabi Bamgboye E.,"Background:- Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and Human Imunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections among high risk groups is an important strategy for the control of the diseases which occurrence have been on the increase worldwide. The objective of this study is to provide a descriptive epidemiology of the pattern of STDs among clinic attendees at a Special Treatment Clinic (STC) of the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan. Study design:- A retrospective review of records of all new patients presenting at the STC between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2000 was carried out. Results:- Clinic records were available for 336 new patients who visited the clinic in the year under review. The result showed that non-gonococcal urethritis (45.2%) and gonococcal urethritis (15.9%) were the most common STDs in men, while candidiasis (37.2%) and gardrellena vaginitis (31.8%) were the most common in women. Three 3(1.1%) of the patients had HIV infection, which had not been previously reported in the clinic. Conclusion:- The findings indicate a change morbidity pattern in the STD clinic that suggests the need to include HIV/AIDS management and care in the services provided.",2004,,West African Journal of Medicine,23,3,236-239,,10.4314/wajm.v23i3.28129,,#2390,Fatiregun 2004,Exclusion reason: 5.

"Chlamydia trachomatis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) distribution and sexual behaviors across gender and age group in an African setting.",Djoba Siawaya JF.,"The purpose of this study was to (1) describe the distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) cases across gender and age groups in Libreville (Gabon); (2) examine Gabonese Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)-related risk behaviour. The sampled population was people attending the ""Laboratoire National de Santé Plublique"". Between 2007 and 2011, 14 667 and 9 542 people respectively, were tested for CT and HIV infections. 1 854 of them were tested for both infections. We calculated CT and HIV rates across gender and age groups. Also analysed was the groups' contribution to the general CT and HIV epidemiology. STIs-related risk behaviours were assessed in 224 men and 795 women (between July 2011 and March 2013) who agreed and answered a questionnaire including questions on their marital status, number of sex partners, sexual practices, history of STIs, sex frequency and condom use. Data showed a 24% dropped in the CT infection rate between 2007 and 2010, followed by a 14% increase in 2011. The HIV infection rates for the same period were between 15% and 16%. The risk of a CT-positive subject getting HIV is about 0.71 times the risk of a CT-negative subject. Young adult aged between 18 and 35 years old represented 65.2% of people who had STIs. 80% of women and 66% of men confessed to an inconsistent use of condoms. 11.6% of women and 48% of men declared having multiple sex partners. 61% of questioned women and 67% of men declared knowing their HIV status. In this Gabonese setting, the population-aged from 18 to 35 years is the most affected by STIs.

"The risk factor profile of women with secondary infertility: an unmatched case-control study in Kigali, Rwanda.",Dhont N.; Luchters S.; Muvunyi C.; Vyankandondera J.; De Naeyer L.; Temmerman M.; van de Wijgert J.,"Secondary infertility is a common, preventable but neglected reproductive health problem in resource-poor countries. This study examines the association of past sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV, bacterial vaginosis (BV) and factors in the obstetric history with secondary infertility and their relative contributions to secondary infertility. Between November 2007 and May 2009 a research infertility clinic was set up at the Kigali University Teaching Hospital in Rwanda. Cases were defined as sexually-active women aged 21-45 years presenting with secondary infertility (n = 177), and controls as multiparous women in the same age groups who recently delivered (n = 219). Participants were interviewed about socio-demographic characteristics and obstetric history using structured questionnaires, and were tested for HIV and reproductive tract infections (RTIs). Risk factors in the obstetric history for secondary infertility were lack of prenatal care in the last pregnancy, the first pregnancy before the age of 21 years, a history of unwanted pregnancy, a pregnancy with other than current partner, an adverse pregnancy outcome, stillbirth, postpartum infection and curettage. Presence of HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), or Treponema pallidum antibodies, and bacterial vaginosis (BV), were significantly more common in women in secondary infertile relationships than those in fertile relationships. The population attributable fractions (PAF%) for obstetric events, HIV, other (STIs), and BV were 25%, 30%, 27%, and 14% respectively. The main finding of this study is that obstetric events, HIV and other STIs contribute approximately equally to secondary infertility in Rwanda.

Low prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections and no evidence of resistance against third generation cephalosporins in a cohort of HIV positive patients from a tertiary hospital in Tanzania,Deutschmann S.; Bohne W.; Mujuni F.; Kalluvya S.; Mshana S.; Gross U.; Mueller A.,"INTRODUCTION Gonorrhoea is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI) worldwide. Resistances against each first-line antimicrobial, including third-generation Cephalosporins have emerged. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is mandatory therefore to ensure an appropriate reaction to this emerging pathogen. Due to limited resources there is lack of surveillance for NG and monitoring of AMR in most of the African countries including Tanzania. MATERIALS AND METHODS During August and September 2014 we conducted a cross-sectional study on the prevalence of NG infection among male and female adult HIV-positive patients attending a continuous treatment and care (CTC) clinic in Mwanza, Tanzania, for a regular check. First stream urine samples of 15 ml each were centrifuged and the sediment stored in a lysis buffer at -20°C until analysis. For DNA extraction the Roche MagNA Pure™ system was used. A protocol on a lightcycler targeting the porA-gene was used to detect gonococcal DNA. Detection of cephalosporin resistance was done by amplification of the penA gene on a light cycler followed by sequencing of the PCR products. Cephalosporine resistance was defined as detection of the penA mosaic gene. RESULTS 512 patients were included, 261 males and 251 females. The age ranged from 19 to 82 years with a mean age of 42.5 years and a median age of 42 years. The overall prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was 2.15% (N = 512; positives = 11) in our study cohort. The penA mosaic gene was not detected in any of the isolated strains. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of NG infection among HIV positive patients attending a specialized HIV clinic in Mwanza, North-western Tanzania, for a regular check was relatively low. In this recent study there was no evidence of resistance to third generation cephalosporines using molecular antibiotic resistance testing. Further surveillance for NG and AMR testing needs to be implemented. Molecular diagnostic techniques based on urine samples as diagnostic material for the detection of NG have substantial advantages for screening purposes.",2015,,Tropical Medicine and International Health,20,"(Mujuni F.; Kalluvya S.; Mshana S.)

"Bacterial vaginosis, vaginal flora patterns and vaginal hygiene practices in patients presenting with vaginal discharge syndrome in The Gambia, West Africa",Demba E.; Morison L.; van der Loeff M.S.; Awasana A.A.; Gooding E.; Bailey R.; Mayaud P.; West B.,"Background: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) - a syndrome characterised by a shift in vaginal flora - appears to be particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known of the pattern of vaginal flora associated with BV in Africa. We conducted a study aimed at determining the prevalence of BV and patterns of BV-associated vaginal micro-flora among women with vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) in The Gambia, West Africa. Methods: We enrolled 227 women with VDS from a large genito-urinary medicine clinic in Fajara, The Gambia. BV was diagnosed by the Nugent's score and Amsel's clinical criteria. Vaginal swabs were collected for T vaginalis and vaginal flora microscopy, and for Lactobacillus spp, aerobic organisms, Candida spp and BV-associated bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma spp) cultures; and cervical swabs were collected for N gonorrhoeae culture and C trachomatis PCR. Sera were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Sexual health history including details on sexual hygiene were obtained by standardised questionnaire. Results: BV prevalence was 47.6% by Nugent's score and 30.8% by Amsel's clinical criteria. Lactobacillus spp were isolated in 37.8% of women, and 70% of the isolates were hydrogen-peroxide (H202)-producing strains. Prevalence of BV-associated bacteria were: G vaginalis 44.4%; Bacteroides 16.7%; Prevotella 15.2%; Peptostretococcus 1.5%; Mobiluncus 0%; other anaerobes 3.1%; and Mycoplasma hominis 21.4%. BV was positively associated with isolation of G vaginalis (odds-ratio [OR] 19.42, 95%CI 7.91 -47.6) and anaerobes (P = 0.001 [OR] could not be calculated), but not with M hominis. BV was negatively associated with presence of Lactobacillus (OR 0.07, 95%CI 0.03 - 0.15), and H2O2-producing lactobacilli (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.28). Presence of H2O2-producing lactobacilli was associated with significantly lower prevalence of G vaginalis, anaerobes and C trachomatis. HIV prevalence was 12.8%. Overall, there was no association between BV and HIV, and among micro-organisms associated with BV, only Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. were associated with HIV. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with any of the factors relating to sexual hygiene practices (vaginal douching, menstrual hygiene, female genital cutting). Conclusion: In this population, BV prevalence was higher than in corresponding populations in industrialised countries, but the pattern of vaginal micro-flora associated with BV was similar. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with HIV nor with any of the vaginal hygiene characteristics. © 2005 Demba et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2005,,BMC Infectious Diseases,5,"(Demba E., edemba@mrc.gm)",,,10.1186/1471-2334-5-12,,#2454,Demba 2005,Exclusion reason: 7.

An unblinded, individually randomised and controlled trial. 10 villages within the Kilombero/Ulanga districts of the Ifakara Health and Demographic Surveillance System in rural south-west Tanzania. The authors enrolled 2399 participants, aged 18-30 years, including adult spouses. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control arm (n=1124) or one of two intervention arms: low-value conditional cash transfer (eligible for $10 per testing round, n=660) and high-value conditional cash transfer (eligible for $20 per testing round, n=615). The authors tested participants every 4 months over a 12-month period for the presence of common sexually transmitted infections. In the intervention arms, conditional cash transfer payments were tied to negative sexually transmitted infection test results. Anyone testing positive for a sexually transmitted infection was offered free treatment, and all received counselling. The primary study end point was combined prevalence of the four sexually transmitted infections, which were tested and reported to subjects every 4 months: Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium. The authors also tested for HIV, herpes simplex virus 2 and syphilis at baseline and month 12. At the end of the 12-month period, for the combined prevalence of any of the four sexually transmitted infections, which were tested and reported every 4 months (C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, T vaginalis and M genitalium), unadjusted RR for the high-value conditional cash transfer arm compared to controls was 0.80 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.06) and the adjusted RR was 0.73 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.99). Unadjusted RR for the high-value conditional cash transfer arm compared to the low-value conditional cash transfer arm was 0.76 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.03) and the adjusted RR was 0.69 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.92). No harm was reported. Conditional cash transfers used to incentivise safer sexual practices are a potentially promising new tool in HIV and sexually transmitted infections prevention. Additional larger study would be useful to clarify the effect size, to calibrate the size of the incentive and to determine whether the intervention can be delivered cost effectively.

"Non-Sexual Transmission of Trichomonas vaginalis in Adolescent Girls Attending School in Ndola, Zambia","Crucitti, T.; Jespers, V.; Mulenga, C.; Khondowe, S.; Vandepitte, J.; Buve, A.","Objectives: To identify risk factors for trichomoniasis among young women in Ndola, Zambia. Method: The study was a cross-sectional study among adolescent girls aged 13-16 years in Ndola, Zambia. Study participants were recruited from schools in selected administrative areas that represented the different socio-economic strata in town. Consenting participants were interviewed about their socio-demographic characteristics; sexual behaviour; and hygiene practices. Self-administered vaginal swabs were tested for Trichomonas vaginalis. HSV-2 antibodies were determined on serum to validate the self-reported sexual activity. Results: A total of 460 girls participated in the study. The overall prevalence of trichomoniasis was 27.1%, 33.9% among girls who reported that they had ever had sex and 24.7% among virgins. In multivariate analysis the only statistically significant risk factor for trichomoniasis was inconsistent use of soap. For the virgins, none of the risk factors was significantly associated with trichomoniasis, but the association with use of soap (not always versus always) and type of toilet used (pit latrine/bush versus flush toilet) was of borderline significance. Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of trichomoniasis in girls in Ndola who reported that they had never had sex. We postulate that the high prevalence of trichomoniasis in virgins in Ndola is due to non-sexual transmission of trichomoniasis via shared bathing water and inconsistent use of soap.",2011,Jan,PLoS One,6,1,5,WOS:000286834300049,10.1371/journal.pone.0016310,,#7400,Crucitti 2011,Exclusion reason: 6.

Mobile device for disease diagnosis and data tracking in resource-limited settings.,Chin CD.; Cheung YK.; Laksanasopin T.; Modena MM.; Chin SY.; Sridhara AA.; Steinmiller D.; Linder V.; Mushingantahe J.; Umviligihozo G.; Karita E.; Mwambarangwe L.; Braunstein SL.; van de Wijgert J.; Sahabo R.; Justman JE.; El-Sadr W.; Sia SK.,"Collection of epidemiological data and care of patients are hampered by lack of access to laboratory diagnostic equipment and patients' health records in resource-limited settings. We engineered a low-cost mobile device that combines cell-phone and satellite communication technologies with fluid miniaturization techniques for performing all essential ELISA functions. We assessed the device's ability to perform HIV serodiagnostic testing in Rwanda and synchronize results in real time with electronic health records. We tested serum, plasma, and whole blood samples collected in Rwanda and on a commercially available sample panel made of mixed antibody titers. HIV testing on 167 Rwandan patients evaluated for HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections yielded diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99%, respectively. Testing on 40 Rwandan whole-blood samples-using 1 μL of sample per patient-resulted in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100%. The mobile device also successfully transmitted all whole-blood test results from a Rwandan clinic to a medical records database stored on the cloud.

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine exhibits dose-response protection against adverse birth outcomes related to malaria and sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections,Chico R.M.; Chaponda E.B.; Ariti C.; Chandramohan D.,"Background. We conducted a prospective cohort study in Zambia among pregnant women who received intermittent preventive treatment using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). Methods. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) of adverse birth outcomes by IPTp-SP exposure, 0-1 dose (n = 126) vs ≥2 doses (n = 590) and ≥2 doses (n = 310) vs ≥3 doses (n = 280) in 7 categories of malaria infection and sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections (STIs/RTIs). Results. We found no significant differences in baseline prevalence of infection across IPTp-SP exposure groups. However, among women given 2 doses compared to 0-1 dose, the odds of any adverse birth outcome were reduced 45% (OR, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36, 0.86) and 13% further with ≥3 doses (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.27, 0.68). Two or more doses compared to 0-1 dose reduced preterm delivery by 58% (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27, 0.67) and 21% further with ≥3 doses (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.13, 0.35). Women with malaria at enrollment who received ≥2 doses vs 0-1 had 76% lower odds of any adverse birth outcome (OR, 0.24; 95% 0.09, 0.66), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis had 92% lower odds of any adverse birth outcome (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.64). Women with neither a malaria infection nor STIs/RTIs who received ≥2 doses had 73% fewer adverse birth outcomes (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.68). Conclusions.

"Lack of knowledge of HIV status a major barrier to HIV prevention, care and treatment efforts in Kenya: results from a nationally representative study.",Cherutich P.; Kaiser R.; Galbraith J.; Williamson J.; Shiraishi RW.; Ngare C.; Mermin J.; Marum E.; Bunnell R.;  .,"We analyzed HIV testing rates, prevalence of undiagnosed HIV, and predictors of testing in the Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) 2007. KAIS was a nationally representative sero-survey that included demographic and behavioral indicators and testing for HIV, HSV-2, syphilis, and CD4 cell counts in the population aged 15-64 years. We used gender-specific multivariable regression models to identify factors independently associated with HIV testing in sexually active persons. Of 19,840 eligible persons, 80% consented to interviews and blood specimen collection. National HIV prevalence was 7.1% (95% CI 6.5-7.7). Among ever sexually active persons, 27.4% (95% CI 25.6-29.2) of men and 44.2% (95% CI 42.5-46.0) of women reported previous HIV testing. Among HIV-infected persons, 83.6% (95% CI 76.2-91.0) were unaware of their HIV infection. Among sexually active women aged 15-49 years, 48.7% (95% CI 46.8-50.6) had their last HIV test during antenatal care (ANC). In multivariable analyses, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for ever HIV testing in women ≥35 versus 15-19 years was 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.3; p<0.0001). Other independent associations with ever HIV testing included urban residence (AOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.0; p = 0.0005, women only), highest wealth index versus the four lower quintiles combined (AOR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.5; p = 0.0006, men only), and an increasing testing trend with higher levels of education. Missed opportunities for testing were identified during general or pregnancy-specific contacts with health facilities; 89% of adults said they would participate in home-based HIV testing.

Prevalence of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Risk Behaviors from the NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial.,Celentano DD.; Mayer KH.; Pequegnat W.; Abdala N.; Green AM.; Handsfield HH.; Hartwell TD.;  .,"This cross-sectional study describes the baseline prevalence and correlates of common bacterial and viral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and risk behaviors among individuals at high risk for HIV recruited in five low- and middle-income countries. Correlations of risk behaviors and demographic factors with prevalent STDs and the association of STDs with HIV prevalence are examined. Between 2,212 and 5,543 participants were recruited in each of five countries (China, India, Peru, Russia, and Zimbabwe). Standard protocols were used to collect behavioral risk information and biological samples for STD testing. Risk factors for HIV/STD prevalence were evaluated using logistic regression models. STD prevalence was significantly higher for women than men in all countries, and the most prevalent STD was Herpes simplex virus-type 2 (HSV-2). HIV prevalence was generally low (below 5%) except in Zimbabwe (30% among women, 11.7% among men). Prevalence of bacterial STDs was generally low (below 5% for gonorrhea and under 7% for syphilis in all sites), with the exception of syphilis among female sex workers in India. Behavioral and demographic risks for STDs varied widely across the five study sites. Common risks for STDs included female gender, increasing number of recent sex partners, and in some sites, older age, particularly for chronic STDs (i.e., HSV-2 and HIV).

Aetiology of genital ulcer disease in female partners of male participants in a circumcision trial in Uganda.,Brankin AE.; Tobian AA.; Laeyendecker O.; Suntoke TR.; Kizza A.; Mpoza B.; Kigozi G.; Nalugoda F.; Iga B.; Chen MZ.; Gray RH.; Wawer MJ.; Quinn TC.; Reynolds SJ.,"HIV acquisition is associated with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection and genital ulcer disease (GUD). Three randomized control trials demonstrated that male circumcision significantly decreases HIV, HSV-2, human papillomavirus and self-reported GUD among men. GUD is also decreased among female partners of circumcised men, but it is unknown whether male circumcision status affects GUD pathogens in female partners. For the evaluation of GUD aetiology, two separate multiplex assays were performed to detect Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema pallidum, HSV-1 and HSV-2. Of all the female GUD swabs evaluated, 67.5% had an aetiology identified, and HSV-2 was the primary pathogen detected (96.3%). However, there was no difference in the proportion of ulcers due to HSV-2 or other pathogens between female partners of circumcised men (11/15, 73.3%) compared with uncircumcised men (15/25, 60.0%, P = 0.39). The seroprevalence of HSV-2 is high in this population and therefore most of the detected HSV-2 infections represent reactivation.

In Liberia, incidence and prevalence data for human papillomavirus (HPV) and CC are unknown. The purpose of this study was to establish baseline data regarding HPV, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), CC, and known risk factors among Liberia women. Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained from both our institution and the University of Liberia, Monrovia. Fourteen volunteer nurses (VN) underwent training as health care providers for this program, as previously described. Women enrolled in the study consented to gynecologic examination by a VN in the presence of physician staff until 60 supervised examinations were performed, after which trained VNs acted independently. Demographic information was collected and included sexual and lifestyle history. Women were included if they were aged 16-85 years, had no previous history of cervical cancer, and were not pregnant. The examination included visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA); Papanicolaou (Pap); and testing for HPV, gonorrhea/chlamydia (GC/C), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and syphilis (RPR). VIA findings consistent with low-grade CIN were offered treatment with cryotherapy at the time of VIA or within 48 h. Women with lesions suspicious for high-grade CIN or invasive cervical cancer underwent colposcopy-guided biopsy and were treated according to consultation with a gynecologic oncologist. Results: A total of 1041 women consented for participation; 154 participants did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded. VIA was performed on 887 women, of whom 8% had findings consistent with low-grade dysplasia and were scheduled for cryotherapy. A total of 616 cervical smears were submitted for Pap and HPV testing.

In Ndola, the prevalence of HIV infection was 25.0% in circumcised men and 26.0% in uncircumcised men. The power was insufficient to adjust for any differences in sexual behaviour. The differences in epidemic spread of HIV are likely to be due to differences in the probability of transmission of HIV during sexual exposure as well as differences in sexual behaviour.

"Neisseria gonorrhoeae among suspects of sexually transmitted infection in Gambella hospital, Ethiopia: risk factors and drug resistance",Ali S.; Sewunet T.; Sahlemariam Z.; Kibru G.,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a bacterium responsible for one of the classic sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhea. Antibiotic resistant strains are emerging at alarming rate. Multiple sexual partners, unsafe sex and substance use habits are the main host related risk factors for acquiring the infection. Thus, this study aimed at determining the magnitude, its determinants and antimicrobial resistance profile of N. gonorrhoeae in a place where there is risk related cultural practices and relatively high HIV prevalence. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 186 STI suspected patients seen in Gambella hospital from March to July 2015. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and associated risk factors was collected using pre-designed questionnaire. Urethral or endo-cervical swabs were collected aseptically by trained nurses. Then, samples were transported to laboratory and processed within 15 min following standard microbiological culture techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data entry, transforming and analysis was done using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: In this study 11.3 % of the STI suspected patients were confirmed to have N. gonorrhoeae. The rate of infection in males was four times higher than in females accounting 16.0 and 5.0 % respectively (p = 0.049). It was also higher (18.9 %) in 20-24 years age group (p = 0.439). Alcohol intake (p = 0.013), less frequent condom use (p = 0.031), and multiple sex partners (p = 0.024) were associated with increased odds of infection. All N. gonorrhoeae isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefoxitin but all were resistant to penicillin and tetracycline. Alarmingly, 28.6 % of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of urogenital symptoms attributable to N. gonorrhoeae was high (11 %), with highest prevalence among males and young adults. Hence, prevention efforts should consider behavioral risk reduction. Ceftriaxone and cefoxitin can be considered as excellent first-line treatment options. However, alarming rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin challenges the current use of this antibiotic in the syndromic management package of gonococcal infections.

"Epidemiological aspects of genital ulcers at the STI center of the National Institute of Public Hygiene (Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire) 2008 to 2010","Gakoué, D. Z.; Tiembré, I.","MEDLINE Abstract: Genital ulcers are among the seven syndromes of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) identified in Côte d'Ivoire. Ulcerative STIs present a public health problem because of their frequency and their role in the spread of HIV. Our objective was to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of genital ulcers observed in the STI center of the National Institute of Public Hygiene in Abidjan. This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study examined cases seen at the center in 2008 through 2010. We retrospectively reviewed all files of clients aged 10 and older who sought care for the first time at the STI center and received a clinical diagnosis, confirmed by the laboratory, of a STI. Overall, we selected 2488 records. Men accounted for 52.30%. The patients' average age was 32 years. The prevalence of genital ulcers was 3.90%. Genital herpes was the diagnosed mentioned most often by doctors (71.43%), followed by scabies (19.39%) and chancroids (9.18%). Male sex and multiple sexual partners appeared to be risk factors for genital ulcers at this center. Genital ulcers are infrequent. Public awareness campaigns to encourage changes in behavior must continue and intensify. In particular, they must stress control of genital herpes by well-known prevention methods: regular and correct condom use and fewer sexual partners",2017,01/01/,Aspects épidémiologiques des ulcérations génitales au dispensaire anti-vénérien de l'Institut national d'hygiène publique (INHP) d'Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire) de 2008 à 2010.,27,1,90-94,,,,#6783,Gakoué 2017,Exclusion reason: 5.

[Management of sexually transmitted diseases by the syndrome approach and voluntary HIV screening in a specialized dispensary in Antananarivo (Madagascar)].,Gleize L.; Randriamanga R.; Ratsimbazafy N.; Rakotonandrasana S.; Durand P.; Le Bot F.,"In 1994, Médecins du Monde opened a free health centre specialized in STD/AIDS in an ill-favored district of Antananarivo, the Malagasy capital of Madagascar. Besides the medical treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) and AIDS, the centre is responsible for the Information, Education and Communication activities (IEC) within and without the centre towards the residents of the 67 hectares district and the high-risk populations (prostitutes, truck-drivers and transvestites). The project aimed at both preventing the spreading of the VIH infection and reducing the incidence of STD. As the Ministry of Health directed, a syndromic method was applied since 1997 regarding STD. Results for 1998 showed the predominance of the association Neisseria gonorrhae-Chlamydiae among the consultants of both sexes. Negative results from 1,218 HIV serological tests carried out seemed confirm the low prevalence of the HIV infection in Madagascar. Yet, the percentage of positive syphilis serology among the tested consultants was lower than that mentioned in previous surveys.

"Knowledge of HIV/AIDS, sexual behaviour and pevalence of sexually transmitted infections among female students of the University of Buea, Cameroon",Nkuo-Akenji T.; Nkwesheu A.; Nyasa R.; Tallah E.; Ndip R.; Angwafo III F.,"The study investigates the cognitive effect of knowledge and protective practices on the prevalence of HIV and some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female students of the University of Buea, Cameroon. A cross-sectional study involving the analysis of a questionnaire completed by 522 female students and the voluntary testing of 108 sexually active females for HIV, syphilis, Chlamydia and gonorrhoea was carried out. Knowledge of the protective effects of abstinence, condom-use and fidelity were independent of sexual practices (OR = 0.86, p = 0.611, φ = 0.22; OR = 1.26, p = 0.213, φ = 0.05; and OR 1.18, p = 0.344, φ = 0.029, respectively). The prevalence of HIV, syphilis, Chlamydia and gonorrhoea among the participants tested was 3.9%, 6.1%, 24.1% and 30.1%, respectively. We conclude that relatively high prevalence of STIs among female students of the University of Buea stems from inadequate knowledge of the major modes of STI/HIV transmission and inadequate use of preventive methods.

"Trichomoniasis as an indicator for existing sexually transmitted infections in women in Aba, Nigeria",Chigbu L.N.; Aluka C.; Eke R.A.,"Background: Trichomoniasis is a common clinical problem. Many young women in Aba indulge in high-risk sexual behaviours. A large number of these young women are illiterates, and are in the habit of indiscriminate use of antibacterial agents at the slightest symptoms of a lower genital tract infection. Evaluation of bacterial agents associated with lower genital tract infections is therefore met with much frustration. The diagnosis of Trichomoniasis from lower genital tract is simple and its routine screening among women attending clinics would serve as an indicator for serious sexually transmitted infections in Aba. Methods: This study was undertaken among women attending a women hospital in Aba, Abia State, Nigeria (Princess Mary Hospital, Aba). In the study, 360 women who were attending the family and antenatal clinics were selected. Also, those with gynaecological problems, obvious symptoms of lower genital tract infections and those who visited the hospital for ""well women examination"" were included in the study population. High vagial swabs collected from these women were examined microscopically by wet mount preparations and bacteriologically by cultures. Results: Out of 360 women screened for Trichomonas vaginalis through wet mount preparation, and other organisms by culture, 40 (11.1%) were positive for Trichomonas vaginalis, 6(1.7%), 48(13.3%) and 140(38.9%) were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gadnerella vaginalis, and Candida albicans respectively. The difference in age specific distribution of Trichomoniasis was statistically significant using the chi-square (P<0.01). Conclusion: The finding of co-infections of T. vaginalis with G. vaginalis (0.6%), N. gonorrhoeae (0.6%), and C. albicans (2.8%) in this study suggests its role in predisposing the carriers to other serious sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection. There is therefore the need for routine examination of sexually active women for the screening of Trichomonas vaginalis in order to effect increased control efforts. Also, the isolation of T. vaginalis in the genital secretions should lead to a search for other sexually transmitted organisms.",2006,,Annals of African Medicine,5,1,1-5,,,,#2963,Chigbu 2006,Exclusion reason: 6.

"Sexually transmitted infections among patients attending the General Practice Clinic, Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa, Nigeria",Olakolu S.S.; Abioye-Kuteyi E.A.; Oyegbade O.O.,"Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common infectious diseases in the world today. There are few reliable statistics on the true prevalence of STIs in developing countries, especially in the general practice setting, hence the need to determine the prevalence in each locality. With the scourge and pandemicity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the fact that STIs are recognised as independent risk factors for its transmission, determining the risk profiles for STIs has become paramount. The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of STIs among patients attending a Nigerian general practice (GP) clinic. Methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional, hospital-based study. Consenting patients were recruited serially between February and April 2006 until the sample size of 415 was reached. Subjects' genital symptoms were considered according to the four common STI syndromes according to National AIDS/STD Control Programme guidelines. Results: The age range of the subjects was 15 to 95 years (mean 45.16 years, standard deviation 18.83 years, median 44 years). The median age at coitarche was 21 years while the median age at marriage was 25 years. The prevalence rates of current, past and lifetime STI were 18.8%, 22.4% and 32% respectively. Only 28 (6.8%) study subjects had laboratory evidence of STIs at the time of study. Previous sex with a commercial sex worker, previous history of STIs, premarital sex, first intercourse before or at 21 years of age and multiple sexual partners were significantly associated with STIs. Previous history of STIs was a strong predictor of current STI in this study while premarital sex and previous sex with a commercial sex worker were strong predictors of past STI. The frequency of HIV infection among subjects with STIs was more than double that of the control and a co-infection rate of 17.9% was found. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate a high prevalence of STIs in the study community in association with prevailing high sexual risk behaviours, hence the need for reliable control programmes targeting the latter. © SAAFP.",2011,,South African Family Practice,53,1,63-70,,10.1080/20786204.2011.10874062,,#3121,Olakolu 2011,Exclusion reason: 8.

Continuing communicable disease burden in Eritrea,Mufunda J.; Nyarango P.; Kosia A.; Ogbamariam A.; Mebrahtu G.; Usman A.; Gebresillosie S.; Goitom S.; Araya E.; Andemichaell G.; Gebremichael A.,"Background and methods. A retrospective study of the national health profile of Eritreans, focusing on acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), tuberculosis (TB), diarrhoea, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS, was done on data from 1998 to 2003 through a health information management system. Records were included for patients of all ages receiving outpatient and inpatient hospital services during the study period. All incidence rates were given as cases per 100 000 population. Results. The incidence of ARTI increased from 6 500 cases per annum in 1998 to 8 500 in 2003, representing a 30% increase. Diarrhoea rates remained unchanged, averaging 3 000 cases. For both ARTI and diarrhoea, rates were at least 3 times higher in children under 5 years of age than in those over 5 years of age. The incidences of TB and STDs decreased from 370 and 220 in 1998 to 170 and 80 in 2003, respectively. HIV/AIDS incidence increased from 40 in 1998 to 65 in 2003, reflecting a 60% increase. The case fatality rates (CFRs) for HIV/AIDS and TB were 12% and 2% in 1998, increasing to 14% and 3%, respectively, in 2001. The CFR for ARTI and diarrhoea remained low at 0.3%. CFRs were higher in children under 5 years than in those over 5 years for all the diseases but rates declined consistently, probably reflecting the positive impact of the introduction of the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI). Although the incidence rate of HIV/AIDS was relatively low compared with rates for TB, ARTI and diarrhoea, the HIV/AIDS CFR was relatively high, posing a threat to the gains made in control of infectious diseases. The disease burden from TB and STDs declined over the 6-year study period, while that from ARTI and HIV/AIDS increased. Consequently the overall disease burden from communicable diseases remained unchanged over the study period.",2006,,South African Medical Journal,96,3,221-224,,,,#2909,Mufunda 2006,Exclusion reason: 8.

Incidence rate of sexually transmitted infections among HIV infected patients on long-term ART in an urban and a rural clinic in Uganda.,Okoboi S.; Castelnuovo B.; Moore DM.; Musaazi J.; Kambugu A.; Birungi J.; Nanfuka M.; Van Rie A.,"HIV immunosuppression increases susceptibility to other STIs and STIs can enhance HIV transmission, reduce CD4 cell count and increase viral load. Co-infections of HIV and STIs may thus reduce the preventive benefits of ART. Little is known about the incidence rate of STIs among long-term patients on ART. We conducted a secondary data analysis of all patients enrolled in a rural and an urban longitudinal cohort studies who initiated ART between April 2003 and July 2007 followed up to 2016. Patients were screened for STI every three months using ""a syndromic and case management approaches"". STI incidence rate, was defined as the number of new cases per population at risk over the follow-up review period. We performed a time-to-event and Kaplan Meier analysis. We used a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model to assess for factors associated with STI incidence. Of 1012 participants, 402 (39.8%) were urban and 610 (60.2%) rural residents. Mean age was 42.8 years (SD 8.5). The total number of follow up time was 44,304 person years. We observed STI incidence rate of 2.1 per 1000 person-years after follow-up. Rural residence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.53, 95% CI: 1.95-6.39), younger age (aHR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.02-4.12 for 18-34 years and aHR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.00-2.72 for 35-44 years) were factors associated with higher incidence of STIs. Being male (aHR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.27-0.93) was associated with a lower incidence of STIs. We found STIs incidence rate of approximately 3 per 1000 person-years among patients on long-term (≥ 4 years) ART followed up-to 3.5 years. Rural and younger persons on ART should be routinely screened for STIs because high incidence of STIs may undo the preventative effects of ART for all.",2019,Jan,BMC public health,19,1,87,,10.1186/s12889-019-6417-x,30658611,#1712,Okoboi 2019,Exclusion reason: 8.

Objective: To present data on the prevalence of, and risk factors for, cervical HPV 6 and 11 in high-risk women in Burkina Faso. Methods 306 women were enrolled. HIV status and CD4+ counts were determined. Among other genital samples, a cervical swab (Cervex) was collected for liquid-based cytology and HPV genotyping using MY09/MY11 and GP5+/GP6+ PCRs, and INNO-LiPA genotyping v2. Risk factors were examined using logistic regression. Results: HIV-1 seroprevalence was 40% (123/306). Cervical HPV DNA was detected in 55% (100/183) of HIV-uninfected women, 84% (78/93) of HIV-1 infected women with CD4+ T-cell counts >200 cells/ml and 97% (29/30) of HIV-1 infected women with CD4+ T-cell counts ≤200 cells/ml (ptrend<0.001).

We assessed Carraguard, a carrageenan-based compound developed by the Population Council, for its efficacy and long-term safety in prevention of HIV infection in women. We undertook a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in three South African sites in sexually-active, HIV-negative women, aged 16 years and older. 6202 participants, who were randomly assigned by a block randomisation scheme to Carraguard (n=3103) or placebo (methylcellulose [n=3099]), were instructed to use one applicator of gel plus a condom during each vaginal sex act. Participants were followed up for up to 2 years. Visits every 3 months included testing for HIV presence and pregnancy, pelvic examinations, risk reduction counselling, and treatment for curable sexually transmitted infections and symptomatic vaginal infections. The primary outcome was time to HIV seroconversion. Analysis was in the efficacy population (a subset of the intention-to-treat population, excluding participants for whom efficacy could not be assessed). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00213083. For the primary outcome (time to HIV seroconversion) we analysed 3011 women in the Carraguard group and 2994 in the placebo group. HIV incidence was 3.3 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 2.8-3.9) in the Carraguard group (134 events) and 3.8 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 3.2-4.4) in the placebo group (151 events), with no significant difference in the distribution of time to seroconversion (p=0.30).

This paper describes the baseline socio-demographic characteristics of the Mozambique Microbicides Development Programme (MDP) feasibility cohort, baseline prevalence of HIV and other STIs, and HIV incidence. The Mozambique MDP feasibility study was conducted from September 2007 to August 2009 in urban Mavalane and rural Manhiça, in Southern Mozambique. Sexually active, HIV negative women aged 18 years and above were recruited to attend the study clinic every 4 weeks for a total of 40 weeks. At baseline, we collected demographic and sexual behaviour data, samples to test for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and conducted HIV rapid testing. STI and HIV testing were repeated at clinical follow-up visits. We describe HIV prevalence of women at screening, the demographic, behavioural and clinical characteristics of women at enrolment, and HIV incidence during follow-up. We screened 793 women (369 at Mavalane and 424 at Manhiça) and enrolled 505 eligible women (254 at Mavalane and 251 at Manhiça). Overall HIV prevalence at screening was 17%; 10% at Mavalane and 22% at Manhiça. Women screened at Manhiça were twice as likely as women screened at Mavalane to be HIV positive and HIV positive status was associated with younger age (18-34), lower educational level, not using a reliable method of contraception and being Zionist compared to other Christian religions. At enrolment contraceptive use was low in both clinics at 19% in Mavalane and 21% in Manhiça, as was reported condom use at last sex act at 48% in Mavalane and 25% in Manhiça. At enrolment, 8% of women tested positive for Trichomonas vaginalis, 2% for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 4% for Chlamydia trachomatis and 46% for bacterial vaginosis. In Manhiça, 8% of women had active syphilis at screening. HIV incidence was 4.3 per 100 person years at Mavalane and 9.2 per 100 person years at Manhiça.

The role of in-migrants in the increasing rural HIV-1 epidemic: results from a village population survey in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania.,Mmbaga EJ.; Leyna GH.; Hussain A.; Mnyika KS.; Sam NE.; Klepp KI.,"To investigate the magnitude of rural in-migration and the role of in-migrants in the observed increase in HIV-1 prevalence in rural Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. A cross-sectional study involving the adult population aged 15-44 years residing in a rural village was conducted from March to May of 2005. Participants were interviewed regarding their risk behaviors and gave blood for HIV-1 and syphilis testing. Overall, the response rate was 73.0% (1528/2093). A total of 699 (48.1%) participants reported having in-migrated to the village at some point during their life. The prevalences of HIV-1 infection were 1.8%, 2.3%, and 3.7% among non-in-migrant, long-term in-migrant, and recent in-migrant men, respectively (p(trend)<0.001). The corresponding prevalences among women were 9.2%, 11.5%, and 14.5%, respectively (p(trend)=0.048). The odds of HIV-1 infection were higher among recent in-migrants as compared to non-in-migrants (men: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.4, 95% CI 1.8-6.6; women: AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-5.0). Risk behaviors were inversely related to years since in-migration for both sexes. The results suggest that rural in-migration is common for both men and women. In-migrants were at higher risk for HIV-1 infection and contributed significantly to increased rural HIV-1 prevalence. More studies to examine the rate and broader causes of rural in-migration in similar communities are called for.

Sexual behavior and STI/HIV status among adolescents in rural Malawi: an evaluation of the effect of interview mode on reporting.,Mensch BS.; Hewett PC.; Gregory R.; Helleringer S.,"This study investigates the reporting of premarital sex in rural southern Malawi. It summarizes the results of an interview-mode experiment conducted with unmarried young women aged 15-21 in which respondents were randomly assigned to either an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) or a conventional face-to-face (FTF) interview. In addition, biomarkers were collected for HIV and three STIs: gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Prior to collecting the biomarkers, nurses conducted a short face-to-face interview in which they repeated questions about sexual behavior. The study builds on earlier research among adolescents in Kenya where we first investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of ACASI. In both Malawi and Kenya, the mode of interviewing and questions about types of sexual partners affect the reporting of sexual activity. Yet the results are not always in accordance with expectations. Reporting for ""ever had sex"" and ""sex with a boyfriend"" is higher in the FTF mode. When we ask about other partners as well as multiple lifetime partners, however, the reporting is consistently higher with ACASI, in many cases significantly so. The FTF mode produced more consistent reporting of sexual activity between the main interview and a subsequent interview. The association between infection status and reporting of sexual behavior is stronger in the FTF mode, although in both modes a number of young women who denied ever having sex test positive for STIs/HIV.",2008,Dec,Studies in family planning,39,4,321-34,,10.1111/j.1728-4465.2008.00178.x,19248718,#1467,Mensch 2008,Exclusion reason: 7.

Oral and injectable contraception use and risk of HIV acquisition among women in sub-Saharan Africa.,McCoy SI.; Zheng W.; Montgomery ET.; Blanchard K.; van der Straten A.; de Bruyn G.; Padian NS.,"To evaluate the effect of oral and injectable hormonal contraception on the risk of HIV acquisition among women in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Secondary data analysis of 4913 sexually active women aged 18-49 years followed for up to 24 months in the Methods for Improving Reproductive Health in Africa (MIRA) phase III effectiveness trial of the diaphragm and lubricant gel for HIV prevention. Participants were interviewed quarterly about contraception and sexual behavior and were tested for pregnancy, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections. We used a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model, weighted by the inverse probability of hormonal contraception use, to compare the risk of HIV acquisition among nonpregnant women reporting use of combined oral contraceptive pills (COC), progestin-only pills (POP), and/or injectable hormonal contraception to women not using these methods. During the study, 283 participants seroconverted. Use of oral contraceptives (POP or COC) was not associated with HIV risk [adjusted hazard ratio (HRa) = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32, 1.78]. Injectable hormonal contraception was associated with a small nonsignificant risk of HIV infection (HR(a) = 1.34, 95% CI 0.75, 2.37).

Association of herpes simplex virus type 2 with the human immunodeficiency virus among urban women in Zimbabwe.,Mbizvo EM.; Msuya Sia E.; Stray-Pedersen B.; Chirenje MZ.; Munjoma M.; Hussain A.,"A cross-sectional study at two urban primary health care clinics in Zimbabwe was conducted among 393 consecutive women. The purpose was to determine the seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), to identify coinfections and to determine the association between HSV-2, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Sera were tested for HSV-2, HIV and syphilis. Genital specimens were tested for the other STIs. The seroprevalence of ulcerative STIs tested was 42.2% for HSV-2 and 3.9% for syphilis. HSV-2 seropositive women had twice the risk of being HIV infected compared to HSV-2 seronegative women, adjusted OR=2.05 (95% CI=1.29-3.23). HSV-2 seropositivity was also associated with older age, a lower level of education, increase in the number of lifetime sexual partners and history of genital ulcers in the past six or more months.

Little is known about the impact of episodic treatment of herpes on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Methods. Women from Ghana and the Central African Republic who had genital ulcers were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of acyclovir plus antibacterials and were monitored for 28 days. Ulcer etiologies and detection of lesionai HIV-1 RNA were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cervicovaginal HIV-1 RNA and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) DNA and plasma HIV-1 RNA were quantitated by real-time PCR. Primary analyses included 118 HIV-1-infected women with HSV-2 ulcers (54 of whom were given acyclovir and 64 of whom were given placebo). Results. Acyclovir had little impact on (1) detection of cervicovaginal HIV-1 RNA (risk ratio [RR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.2) at day 7 of treatment, (2) the mean cervicovaginal HIV-1 RNA load (-0.06 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, -0.4 to 0.3 log10 copies/mL) at day 7 of treatment, or (3) the plasma HIV-1 RNA load (+0.09 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3 log10 copies/mL) at day 14 of treatment. At day 7, women receiving acyclovir were less likely to have detectable lesionai HIV-1 RNA (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.4-1.2) or cervicovaginal HSV-2 DNA (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.4-1.3), had a lower quantity of HSV-2 DNA (-0.99 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, -1.8 to -0.2 log10 copies/mL), and were more likely to have a healed ulcer (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.9-1.9).

WHO-recommended syndromic STI and BV management is limited as large numbers of women with asymptomatic infections go untreated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate genital cytokine profiles as a biomarker to identify women with asymptomatic, treatable infections. Methods Luminex was used to measure the concentrations of 42 cytokines in cervicovaginal lavages (CVL) from 227 HIVuninfected women from Durban, South Africa, and nine cytokines in endocervical swabs from 264 women from Bondo, Kenya and Pretoria, South Africa. Women were screened for BV and treatable STIs (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium) using microscopy and molecular assays. Nonparametric receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression were used to identify cytokine profiles associated with STIs/BV. Results In women from Durban, concomitant increased IL-1α and IL-1β and decreased IP-10 concentrations in CVLs predicted the presence of a treatable genital condition, correctly classifying 76% of women (sensitivity 72%, specificity 81%, PPV 86% and NPV 64%). In a separate validation cohort of women from Bondo and Pretoria, IL-1α, IL-1β and IP-10 concentrations in endocervical swabs correctly classified 72% of the participants according to STI/BV status. This approach performed substantially better than clinical signs in both cohorts from Durban (sensitivity 19%, specificity 92%, PPV 79% and NPV 40%) and Pretoria and Bondo (sensitivity 29%, specificity 78%, PPV 68%, NPV 39%). Conclusion Across two cohorts of women residing in different regions in sub-Saharan Africa, genital IL-1α, IL-1β and IP-10 together was the best immunological predictor of the presence of an STI or BV. Supplementing syndromic management with point-of-care assessment of biomarkers of genital inflammation may improve STI/BV management for women, enabling more effective treatment of asymptomatic infections and potentially reducing their risk of HIV infection.",2015,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,91,"(Passmore J.S.)

Inflammatory cytokine biomarkers of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections and vaginal dysbiosis: a multicentre validation study.,Masson L.; Barnabas S.; Deese J.; Lennard K.; Dabee S.; Gamieldien H.; Jaumdally SZ.; Williamson AL.; Little F.; Van Damme L.; Ahmed K.; Crucitti T.; Abdellati S.; Bekker LG.; Gray G.; Dietrich J.; Jaspan H.; Passmore JS.,"Vaginal dysbiosis and STIs are important drivers of the HIV epidemic and reproductive complications. These conditions remain prevalent, partly because most cases are asymptomatic. We have shown that inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β and interferon-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 are biomarkers for detecting asymptomatic STIs and vaginal dysbiosis (bacterial vaginosis (BV) or intermediate microbiota). This study aimed to validate the performance of these biomarkers in African women recruited regardless of symptoms. IL-1α, IL-1β and IP-10 were measured in menstrual cup secretions, endocervical, lateral vaginal wall and vulvovaginal swabs from 550 women from Pretoria, Soweto and Cape Town, South Africa and Bondo, Kenya using Luminex and ELISA. STIs were assessed by PCR, BV by Nugent scoring and vaginal microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing. Across four study populations and four types of genital specimens, the performance of IL-1α, IL-1β and IP-10 for identification of women with STIs, BV or intermediate microbiota was consistent. Of the genital samples assessed, biomarkers measured in lateral vaginal wall swabs performed best, correctly classifying 76%(95% CI 70% to 81%) of women according to STI, BV or intermediate microbiota status (sensitivity 77%, specificity 71%) and were more accurate than clinical symptoms (sensitivity 41%, specificity 57%) (p=0.0003). Women incorrectly classified as STI/BV positive using the biomarkers had more abundant dysbiosis-associated bacteria, including Prevotella bivia and Gardnerella sp, detected by 16S rRNA sequencing, but not Nugent scoring. Including vaginal pH with the cytokine biomarkers improved the accuracy of the test (82% (95% CI 75% to 88%) correctly classified), although pH alone had poor specificity (61%). An inexpensive, point-of-care screening test including IL-1α, IL-1β and IP-10 (and potentially pH) could be used in resource-limited settings to identify women with asymptomatic STIs and dysbiosis. These women could then be referred for aetiological testing, followed by specific treatment.",2019,02,Sexually transmitted infections,95,1,5-12,,10.1136/sextrans-2017-053506,30018088,#1806,Masson 2019,Exclusion reason: 5.

The effect of trichomoniasis on vaginal HIV-1 shedding in ART-treated women has not been characterized. We tested the hypothesis that T. vaginalis infection would increase vaginal HIV-1 RNA shedding in women on ART, and that successful treatment would reduce vaginal HIV-1 RNA levels. We conducted a prospective cohort study including monthly follow-up of 147 women receiving ART in Mombasa, Kenya. Those with T. vaginalis infection, defined by the presence of motile trichomonads on vaginal saline wet mount, received treatment with single dose metronidazole (2 g). Test of cure was performed at the next monthly visit. Using the pre-infection visit as the reference category, we compared detection of vaginal HIV-1 RNA before versus during and after infection using generalized estimating equations. A cut-off of 100 HIV-1 RNA copies/swab was used as the lower limit for linear quantitation. Among 31 women treated for trichomoniasis, the concentration of vaginal HIV-1 RNA was above the limit for quantitation before, during, and after T. vaginalis infection in 4 (13% [95% CI 4% - 30%]), 4 (13% [95% CI 4% - 30%]), and 5 (16% [95% confidence interval {CI} 5% - 34%]) women respectively.

Socio-cultural correlates and risky sexual behaviour influencing prevalence of HIV/AIDS and STIs in Uganda: A gender perspective,"Patra, S.","The present study focuses on the behavioural factors especially risky sexual behaviours along with the other socio-economic correlates of the high prevalence of STIs and HIV infection in Uganda. The Uganda AIDS Indicator Survey (2011) data is used. The total sample is 16,607 of which 7,122 are men and 9,485 are women. HIV prevalence is high among men (33.4%) and women (50.2%) with any sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or STI symptoms. Women are significantly more vulnerable to any STIs and HIV/AIDS than men. The prevalence of HIV and STIs is much higher among widow, divorced and separated. Drinking alcohol and not using a condom during sex, having two or more sexual partners are the contributing factors to high HIV and STIs prevalence. Awareness of preventive methods and transmission of STIs, and changes in sexual behaviour are required. The difference in the prevalence of STIs and HIV among men and women can be minimised by increasing employment opportunity for women, by securing woman's sexual right through legal protection and by targeting men's perception towards women's sexuality.",2016,,Cogent Social Sciences,2,,8,WOS:000385867700001,10.1080/23311886.2016.1166472,,#5532,Patra 2016,Exclusion reason: 8.

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea in pregnant Batswana women: time to discard the syndromic approach?,"Romoren, M.; Sundby, J.; Velauthapillai, M.; Rahman, M.; Klouman, E.; Hjortdahl, P.","Background: Chlamydia and gonorrhoea are major causes of morbidity among women in developing countries. Both infections have been associated with pregnancy-related complications, and case detection and treatment in pregnancy is essential. In countries without laboratory support, the diagnosis and treatment of cervical infections is based on the syndromic approach. In this study we measured the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhoea among antenatal care attendees in Botswana. We evaluated the syndromic approach for the detection of cervical infections in pregnancy, and determined if risk scores could improve the diagnostic accuracy. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 703 antenatal care attendees in Botswana were interviewed and examined, and specimens were collected for the identification of C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae and other reproductive tract infections. Risk scores to identify attendees with cervical infections were computed based on identified risk factors, and their sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratios and predictive values were calculated. Results: The prevalence of chlamydia was 8%, and gonorrhoea was found in 3% of the attendees. Symptoms and signs of vaginal discharge did not predict cervical infection, and a syndromic approach failed to identify infected women. Age ( youth) risk factor most strongly associated with cervical infection. A risk score with only sociodemographic factors had likelihood ratios equivalent to risk scores which incorporated clinical signs and microscopy results. However, all the evaluated risk scores were of limited value in the diagnosis of chlamydia and gonorrhoea. A cut-off set at an acceptable sensitivity to avoid infected antenatal care attendees who remained untreated would inevitably lead to considerable over-treatment. Conclusion: Although in extensive use, the syndromic approach is unsuitable for diagnosing cervical infections in antenatal care attendees in Botswana. None of the evaluated risk scores can replace this management. Without diagnostic tests, there are no adequate management strategies for C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae in pregnant women in Botswana, a situation which is likely to apply to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

"Maternal and obstetric complications among HIV-infected women treated with highly active antiretroviral treatment at a Regional Hospital in Durban, South Africa.",Sebitloane HM.; Moodley J.,"HIV is the leading cause of maternal deaths in resource-poor countries. The use of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has been shown to almost eliminate vertical transmission and improve maternal health outcomes. Its effect on direct obstetric conditions has not been well documented. We conducted a retrospective study of women who delivered at a regional hospital from April 1, 2011, to April 30, 2014. We employed a stratified random selection, where the first 50 files recorded in the birth register during each calendar month were chosen, at a ratio of one HIV uninfected for every 4 infected women. We analyzed files belonging to 302 HIV-uninfected women and 1159 HIV-infected women. The latter were further subdivided into those who used zidovudine, n = 424; those who initiated HAART prepregnancy, n = 312; and those who initiated in-pregnancy HAART, n = 423. We found that despite the use of HAART, HIV-infected women were at increased risk of both respiratory and lower genital tract infections (P = 0.009 and 0.001 respectively), compared to HIV-uninfected women. The women receiving HAART before pregnancy had an increased risk of preterm births (P = 0.004), and poor perinatal outcomes (P = 0.002); however, postpartum complications were reduced (P = 0.023). There was a trend toward an increased risk of preeclampsia (P = 0.064). The initiation of HAART before pregnancy reduces the frequency of postpartum complications.

From January to August 2009, we assessed socio-demographic variables, sexuality, disclosure of sero-status and STI treatment for 400 patients attending the HIV care and support centre. Characteristics of those who had been treated and those who had never been treated for STIs were compared to identify factors independently associated with STIs. Of the 400 respondents, 25.3% were male, 47.3% were aged 25-34 years, over 85% were currently married or had ever been married, and 62% had primary level of education or less. Though 82.5% were on antiretroviral drugs, only 53.1% disclosed their sero-status to their regular partners and only 41.9% knew the sero-status of their regular partners. Furthermore, 151 (37.7%) had been treated for STIs. The STIs were gonorrhoea (15; 9.7%), chlamydia (11; 7.1%), Trichomonas vaginalis (5; 3.3%), syphilis (99; 64.3%), and mixed infections (21; 13.6%). Factors associated with STI treatment on univariable analysis were age at sexual debut, whether the respondent had had sex in the previous six months, frequency of sexual intercourse, having changed sexual partners, number of sexual partners, and age when the respondent had a first child. Unprotected sexual intercourse and STIs are common among patients seeking HIV care in Uganda. Only the age of sexual debut (odds ratio 0.82, confidence limits 0.71, 0.94) was independently (though inversely) associated with STIs.",2012,Mar,Journal of infection in developing countries,6,3,276-82,,10.3855/jidc.1754,22421610,#1528,Osinde 2012,Exclusion reason: 8.

We assessed whether male circumcision also reduces M genitalium infection in female partners of circumcised men. HIV-negative men were enrolled and randomised to either male circumcision or control. Female partners of male trial participants from the intervention (n=437) and control (n=394) arms provided interview information and self-collected vaginal swabs that were tested for M genitalium by APTIMA transcription-mediated amplification-based assay. Prevalence risk ratios (PRR) and 95% CI of M genitalium prevalence in intervention versus control group were estimated using Poisson regression. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. An as-treated analysis was conducted to account for study-group crossovers. Male and female partner enrolment sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviours, and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections were similar between study arms.

Possible reasons for an increase in the proportion of genital ulcers due to herpes simplex virus from a cohort of female bar workers in Tanzania.,Riedner G.; Todd J.; Rusizoka M.; Mmbando D.; Maboko L.; Lyamuya E.; Hoffmann O.; MacLean I.; Grosskurth H.; Hayes R.,"To determine trends in the prevalence and aetiological distribution of genital ulcer syndrome (GUS) in a cohort of female bar workers and to assess factors associated with these trends. An open cohort of 600 women at high risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) was offered screening and treatment for STI at 3-month intervals. The prevalence of GUS and associated aetiological agents (Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum and Haemophilus ducreyi) were monitored over 27 months through clinical examination, dry lesion swabbing and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The effects of HIV status and other factors on the prevalence trends of STI were assessed. A total of 753 women were recruited into the cohort over 10 examination rounds. At recruitment, the seroprevalence was 67% for HIV and 89% for HSV type 2 (HSV-2). During follow-up, 57% of ulcers had unknown aetiology, 37% were due to genital herpes and 6% to bacterial aetiologies, which disappeared completely in later rounds. The absolute prevalence of genital herpes remained stable at around 2%. The proportion of GUS caused by HSV increased from 22% to 58%, whereas bacterial causes declined. These trends were observed in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive women. The changes observed in the frequency and proportional distribution of GUS aetiologies suggest that regular STI screening and treatment over an extended period can effectively reduce bacterial STI and should therefore be sustained. However, in populations with a high prevalence of HSV-2, there remains a considerable burden of genital herpes, which soon becomes the predominant cause of GUS. Given the observed associations between genital herpes and HIV transmission, high priority should be given to the evaluation of potential interventions to control HSV-2 either through a vaccine or through episodic or suppressive antiviral therapy and primary prevention.",2007,Apr,Sexually transmitted infections,83,2,91-6,,10.1136/sti.2006.021287,16971402,#697,Riedner 2007,Exclusion reason: 8.

Factors associated with problem drinking among women employed in food and recreational facilities in northern Tanzania.,Mongi AS.; Baisley K.; Ao TT.; Chilongani J.; Aguirre-Andreasen A.; Francis SC.; Shao J.; Hayes R.; Kapiga S.,"There is growing evidence that alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of HIV infection. To determine factors associated with problem drinking, we analyzed data collected in two prospective cohorts of at-risk female food and recreational facility workers in northern Tanzania. We enrolled HIV seronegative women aged 18-44 years and employed in the towns of Geita, Kahama, Moshi, and Shinyanga. At enrolment, women were interviewed to obtain information about alcohol use, using CAGE and AUDIT screening scales, and risk factors for HIV infection. Blood and genital samples were collected for detection of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We characterized alcohol use, concordance, and agreement of the scales, and examined the associations between characteristics of participants and problem drinking as defined by both scales using logistic regression. Lastly, we assessed problem drinking as a risk factor for recent sexual behavior and prevalent STIs. Among enrollees, 68% women reported ever drinking alcohol; of these 76% reported drinking alcohol in the past 12 months. The prevalence of problem drinking was 20% using CAGE and 13% using AUDIT. Overall concordance between the scales was 75.0% with a Kappa statistic of 0.58. After adjusting for age, independent factors associated with problem drinking, on both scales, were marital status, occupation, facility type, increasing number of lifetime sexual partners, and transactional sex in the past 12 months. In addition, women who were problem drinkers on either scale were more likely to report having ≥ 1 sexual partner (CAGE: aOR = 1.56, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.10-2.23; aOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.34-3.00) and transactional sex (CAGE: aOR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.26-2.56; aOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.04-2.18), in the past 3 months.

Efficacy of enhanced HIV counseling for risk reduction during pregnancy and in the postpartum period: a randomized controlled trial.,Maman S.; Moodley D.; McNaughton-Reyes HL.; Groves AK.; Kagee A.; Moodley P.,"Pregnancy and the postpartum period present important intervention opportunities. Counseling can leverage the motivation women have during this time to change behaviors that may negatively affect their health and the heath of their infants. Pregnant women attending an antenatal clinic in South Africa were randomly allocated to treatment (n=733) and control arms (n=747). Treatment arm participants received enhanced HIV pre- and post-test counseling, legal support and access to support groups at baseline, which occurred at the first antenatal visit, and then six and ten weeks postpartum. Control arm participants received standard HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and two postpartum attention control sessions. Outcomes were incidence of sexually transmitted infection (STI) by 14 weeks postpartum and past 30-day inconsistent condom use at 14 weeks and 9 months postpartum. There were no intervention effects on incident STIs for either HIV-negative (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.71-1.44) or HIV-positive participants (aRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.23).

An enhanced counseling intervention during pregnancy and the postpartum period can lead to reductions in inconsistent condom use among HIV-negative women. Results underscore the importance of the counseling that accompanies HIV HTC. More work is needed to understand how to promote and sustain risk reduction among HIV-positive women.

Kaposi's Sarcoma Associated-Herpes Virus (KSHV) Seroprevalence in Pregnant Women in South Africa.,Malope-Kgokong BI.; Macphail P.; Mbisa G.; Ratshikhopha E.; Maskew M.; Stein L.; Sitas F.; Whitby D.,"Factors previously associated with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) transmission in Africa include sexual, familial, and proximity to river water. We measured the seroprevalence of KSHV in relation to HIV, syphilis, and demographic factors among pregnant women attending public antenatal clinics in the Gauteng province of South Africa. We tested for antibodies to KSHV lytic K8.1 and latent Orf73 antigens in 1740 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics who contributed blood to the ""National HIV and Syphilis Sero-Prevalence Survey - South Africa, 2001"". Information on HIV and syphilis serology, age, education, residential area, gravidity, and parity was anonymously linked to evaluate risk factors for KSHV seropositivity. Clinics were grouped by municipality regions and their proximity to the two main river catchments defined. KSHV seropositivity (reactive to either lytic K8.1 and latent Orf73) was nearly twice that of HIV (44.6% vs. 23.1%). HIV and syphilis seropositivity was 12.7% and 14.9% in women without KSHV, and 36.1% and 19.9% respectively in those with KSHV. Women who are KSHV seropositive were 4 times more likely to be HIV positive than those who were KSHV seronegative (AOR 4.1 95%CI: 3.4 - 5.7). Although, women with HIV infection were more likely to be syphilis seropositive (AOR 1.8 95%CI: 1.3 - 2.4), no association between KSHV and syphilis seropositivity was observed. Those with higher levels of education had lower levels of KSHV seropositivity compared to those with lower education levels. KSHV seropositivity showed a heterogeneous pattern of prevalence in some localities. The association between KSHV and HIV seropositivity and a lack of common association with syphilis, suggests that KSHV transmission may involve geographical and cultural factors other than sexual transmission.",2010,Aug,Infectious agents and cancer,5,,14,,10.1186/1750-9378-5-14,20807396,#74,Malope-Kgokong 2010,Exclusion reason: 8.

Relative risk of HIV infection among young men and women in a South African township.,MacPhail C.; Williams BG.; Campbell C.,"The prevalence of HIV infection in Africa is substantially higher among young women than it is among young men. Biological explanations of this difference have been presented but there has been little exploration of social factors. In this paper we use data from Carletonville, South Africa to explore various social explanations for greater female infection rates. This paper reports on data from a random sample of 507 people between 13 and 24 years old. Subjects were tested for HIV, as well as other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and answered a behavioural questionnaire. The age-prevalence of HIV infection differs between men and women with considerably higher rates of increase with age among young women. The age of sexual debut did not differ significantly between men and women (15.9 and 16.3 years, respectively) and below the age of 20 years there was no difference in the number or distribution of the number of sexual partners reported by men or women. The risk of infection per partnership was substantially higher among women than among men. Women have sexual partners who are, on average, about five years older than they are with some variation with age. Scaling the age-prevalence curve for men by the age of their sexual partners gives a curve whose shape is indistinguishable from that for women but is about 30% lower for men than for women. In terms of social explanations for HIV rates among women, the data indicates that this difference can be explained by the relative age of sexual partners, but not by other factors explored. In addressing the epidemic among young women it will be essential to deal with the social factors that lead young women to select their partners from older-age cohorts and that shape their sexual networking patterns.",2002,May,International journal of STD & AIDS,13,5,331-42,,10.1258/0956462021925162,11972938,#459,MacPhail 2002,Exclusion reason: 4.

The feasibility of integrated STI prevalence and behaviour surveys in developing countries.,MacLachlan EW.; Baganizi E.; Bougoudogo F.; Castle S.; Mint-Youbba Z.; Gorbach P.; Parker K.; Ryan CA.,"In countries where STI/HIV prevalence data and behavioural data are scarce UNAIDS second generation HIV surveillance guidelines recommend measuring STI/HIV prevalence and risk behaviours in vulnerable populations but do not recommend conducting these surveys concurrently because of concerns about participation rates, cost, and provision of services. To assess the feasibility of conducting a national combined STD prevalence and behaviour survey in Mali among vulnerable populations with the intention of institutionalisation. From March to June 2000 an integrated STI prevalence and behaviour survey was conducted using cluster sampling among five risk groups in four sites in Mali, west Africa. 2229 individuals in non-traditional settings such as taxi/bus stations, market areas, households, and brothels participated in any one or all components of the study: (1) behavioural questionnaire, (2) urine sample for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC)/Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) testing, (3) a fingerstick drop of blood for syphilis, and/or (4) HIV testing. High participation rates of 84%-100% were achieved despite specimen collection and HIV testing. Rates fell only slightly when participants were asked to provide biological samples and participants were more likely to provide urine than blood. Rates among the different groups for HIV and syphilis testing are similar and suggest that refusal was most probably because of a reluctance to give blood rather than because of HIV testing. The cost of the biological component added approximately $30 per participant. Included in the $30 are the costs of training, participant services, laboratory personnel and supplies, STI drugs, and STI testing costs. The total cost of the survey was $154,905. Biomarkers aided in validation of answers to behavioural questions. Consenting individuals received HIV pretest and post-test counselling and referral to a trained health provider for treatment of STI and the provision of services provided the framework for interventions in the groups following the survey.

Genital warts and infection with human immunodeficiency virus in high-risk women in Burkina Faso: A longitudinal study,Low A.J.; Clayton T.; Konate I.; Nagot N.; Ouedraogo A.; Huet C.; Didelot-Rousseau M.; Segondy M.; Van de Perre P.; Mayaud P.,"Background: Human papillomaviruses are the most common sexually transmitted infections, and genital warts, caused by HPV-6 and 11, entail considerable morbidity and cost. The natural history of genital warts in relation to HIV-1 infection has not been described in African women. We examined risk factors for genital warts in a cohort of high-risk women in Burkina Faso, in order to further describe their epidemiology.Methods: A prospective study of 765 high-risk women who were followed at 4-monthly intervals for 27 months in Burkina Faso. Logistic and Cox regression were used to identify factors associated with prevalent, incident and persistent genital warts, including HIV-1 serostatus, CD4+ count, and concurrent sexually transmitted infections. In a subset of 306 women, cervical HPV DNA was tested at enrolment.Results: Genital wart prevalence at baseline was 1.6% (8/492) among HIV-uninfected and 7.0% (19/273) among HIV-1 seropositive women. Forty women (5.2%) experienced at least one incident GW episode. Incidence was 1.1 per 100 person-years among HIV-uninfected women, 7.4 per 100 person-years among HIV-1 seropositive women with a nadir CD4+ count `200 cells/μL and 14.6 per 100 person-years among HIV-1 seropositive women with a nadir CD4+ count ≤200 cells/μL. Incident genital warts were also associated with concurrent bacterial vaginosis, and genital ulceration. Antiretroviral therapy was not protective against incident or persistent genital warts. Detection of HPV-6 DNA and abnormal cervical cytology were strongly associated with incident genital warts.Conclusions: Genital warts occur much more frequently among HIV-1 infected women in Africa, particularly among those with low CD4+ counts.

We investigated associations between Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection and the demographic, clinical, microbiological and behavioural characteristics of these patients. Methods: During six annual surveys (2007-2012), 1,218 MUDS and 1,232 VDS cases were consecutively recruited. Aetiology was determined using nucleic acid amplification assays (N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas Vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium), microscopy of vaginal smears (bacterial vaginosis, Candida) and serology (syphilis, HSV-2, HIV). Chi-squared tests and logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of N. gonorrhoeae infection. Results: There were no significant trends in the prevalence of gonorrhoea among MUDS and VDS patients. Overall, 908 (74.6%) men and 156 (12.7%) women were N. gonorrhoeae positive, with the highest prevalence observed in men aged 30-34 years (79.1%) and women aged 18-19 years (19.2%). N. gonorrhoeae was detected more often in MUDS patients co-infected with HIV (aOR 2.25, 95% CI, 1.59-3.17) but less often among men with co-existent C. trachomatis (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26-0.49), T.

Precancerous Cervix in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Women Thirty Years Old and above in Northern Uganda.,Izudi J.; Adrawa N.; Amongin D.,"Background. Little is known about precancerous cervical lesion (PCCL), the precursor of cervical cancer among Human Immunodeficiency (HIV) infected women in a postconflict setting of Northern Uganda. Objective. To establish factors associated with PCCL among HIV infected women above thirty years of age in a postconflict setting of Northern Uganda. Method. This retrospective cohort study used electronic data from 995 HIV-positive women that attended cervical cancer screening during June 2014 and December 2015. Data on social, sexual, obstetric, and gynecological factors was analyzed at 95% confidence level. Multivariate analysis determined factors independently associated with positive PCCL. Probability value less than 5% was considered significant. Results. Prevalence of PCCL was 3.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-4.3). A positive PCCL was significantly associated with absence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during clinic visits (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 0.24; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09-0.64; P = 0.004) and first pregnancy before the age of 20 years (aOR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.21-7.89; P = 0.018).

The Syndromic versus Laboratory Diagnosis of Sexually Transmitted Infections in Resource-Limited Settings.,Ghebremichael M.,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a severe HIV epidemic. Thus, accurate recognition and diagnosis of STIs are essential for successful HIV prevention programs in the region. Due to lack of trained personnel and adequate laboratory infrastructure in the region, information regarding the profile of STIs relies essentially on self-reported or physician-diagnosed symptoms. The main objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the syndromic diagnosis of STIs, which is often used as a proxy for laboratory diagnosis of STIs in sub-Saharan Africa and other resource-limited settings. The study builds on previously collected data from a community-based survey in Northern Tanzania. We found no significant agreements between patient-reported STIs symptoms and laboratory-confirmed STIs tests. The reported STIs symptoms had high specificity (range = 85-99%) and poor sensitivity (range = 2-17%).

A.; Chen-Mok, M.","OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study is to compare sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence in cohorts of women with and without access to female condoms. METHODS: Six matched pairs of communities were identified from Kenya tea, coffee and flower plantations. One community within each pair was randomly selected to receive the female condom intervention. Approximately 160 eligible women were enrolled at each site. Female condom communities underwent an education program on use of female and male condoms and STDs, comprising group meetings, puppetry and other folk media, and training of clinic service providers and community outreach workers. Control communities received similar information on use of male condoms (freely available at all sites). At baseline, participants were tested for cervical gonorrhea and chlamydia and Vaginal trichomoniasis, to be repeated at 6 and 12 months. The study has 80% power to detect a 10% prevalence difference, assuming an aggregate STD prevalence of 20% with 25% loss to follow-up and intracluster correlation of 0.03. RESULTS: Among 1929 women at baseline, the mean age was 33.1 years; 78% had never used a male condom. The prevalences of gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis were 2.6%, 3.2% and 20.4%, respectively (23.9% overall). The intracluster correlation based on these data was near zero.

Methods: It was a cross-sectional study in a population of women using hormonal contraceptive methods attending Family Planning clinics. Detailed medical history, Endocervical and high vaginal swabs were collected from the women to establish diagnosis after clinical examination and informed consent. Aliquots of sera from venous blood samples of the women were tested for antibodies to HIV-1/2 and RPR. Data was analysed using SPSS for widows' version 15.0. Results: There were 102 women using hormonal contraceptive methods who participated in the study with mean age of 31.92 years (SD = 8.33, range = 16-55).

Observational design. Consenting HIV-1-infected pregnant women (n = 1078) were enrolled in a trial to examine the role of vitamin supplements. Intrauterine HIV-1 infection (HIV-positive at birth); intrapartum and early breastfeeding transmission (HIV-positive at 6 weeks among those uninfected at birth) were defined using the PCR. Of 734 infants who had a specimen taken at birth, 62 were HIV positive [8.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI),6.4--10.5%], whereas 59 infants were positive among 367 infants who were uninfected at birth and were retested at 6 weeks (16.1%; 95%CI, 12.3--19.8%). In multivariate analyses, maternal CD4 cell count, viral load, and clinical stage were significant predictors of both definitions of transmission. Viral load of 50 000 copies/ml or more at delivery was associated with a 4.21-fold increase in risk of intrapartum and early breastfeeding transmission (95%CI, 1.59--11.13;P = 0.004). Babies who were HIV negative at birth and born before 34 weeks of gestation were 2.19 times more likely to become infected during intrapartum and early breastfeeding periods compared with those born after 37 weeks (95%CI, 1.19--4.04; P = 0.01).

It is also associated with protection from some STIs among female partners. However, real-world data on changes in STI transmission associated with large-scale public African medical male circumcision (MMC) conducted for HIV prevention are lacking and would improve estimates of the health impact of MMC. The HIV Incidence Provincial Surveillance System is a community-based surveillance platform for HIV prevalence, incidence and intervention coverage trends in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.

"Influence of infant feeding patterns on early mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in Durban, South Africa.",Coutsoudis A.,"Previous studies on the effect of breastfeeding on mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV have not attempted to examine the influence of different types of breastfeeding practice. To attempt to address some of these inadequacies, infant feeding practices of 549 HIV-infected women involved in a trial in Durban, South Africa were documented prospectively. Women were counseled on infant feeding choices according to UNAIDS guidelines, and those who chose to breastfeed were encouraged to practice exclusive breastfeeding. The MTCT rates of HIV-1 at 3 months were compared in the three different feeding groups (never breastfed, exclusive breastfeeding, and mixed breastfeeding). At 3 months, 18.8% of 156 never-breastfed children were infected compared to 21.3% of 393 breastfed children (p = 0.50). Children exclusively breastfed to at least 3 months (n = 103) were less likely to be infected (14.3%) than those receiving mixed feeding before 3 months (24.1%) (p = 0.03). After adjustment for potential confounders (maternal CD4:CD8 ratio, syphilis screening test results, and preterm delivery), exclusive breastfeeding carried a significantly lower risk of HIV-1 transmission than mixed feeding (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28-0.98) and an equivalent risk to no breastfeeding (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.51-1.42). Our findings have important implications for HIV and infant feeding policies in developing countries, and it is critical that further research be undertaken. In the meantime, breastfeeding policies for HIV-infected women require urgent review.

At initial screening, 71% were asymptomatic. HIV infection (28.4%) and tuberculosis (TB) (21%) were the main reported antecedent illnesses. Laboratory screening revealed anaemia (haemoglobin level <10 mg/dl) in 9% participants, abnormal liver enzymes in 23.9% and a reactive non-treponemal syphilis test in 5%. Of 145 performed chest X-rays, 13% showed abnormalities. All 113 health workers not recently tested for HIV were screened, and 31 were newly diagnosed with HIV infection (resulting in an overall HIV prevalence of 43.8%). Nine cases of TB were diagnosed at screening/during follow-up. In April 2010, all but one of the participants were alive. All HIV-infected health workers under antiretroviral therapy were actively followed-up. Serious conditions were frequently diagnosed in health workers, in particular HIV infection. Mid-term outcome was favourable within this program.

Bacterial vaginosis: risk factors among Kenyan women and their male partners.,Bukusi EA.; Cohen CR.; Meier AS.; Waiyaki PG.; Nguti R.; Njeri JN.; Holmes KK.,"To simultaneously examine associations of bacterial vaginosis (BV) with potential risk factors in both the female and her male partner. We recruited women 18-45 years of age and their male partners from clinics in Nairobi, Kenya. All underwent face-to-face standardized interview physical examination, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and syphilis serologic testing, endocervical cultures for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and vaginal swabs for diagnosis of BV by Gram stain and trichomoniasis by culture. Of 219 women, 97 (44%) had BV. BV was significantly associated by univariate analyses with women's own risk factors (young age, being unmarried, early sexual debut, more than 1 sexual partner, lifetime, rectal sex, trichomoniasis, HIV infection, and by principal components analysis, with low socioeconomic status [SES]) and also with male partners' characteristics (HIV infection, and by principal components analysis, low SES, and poor hygiene). In multivariate analysis including risk factors from both genders, the odds of having BV was 5.7 times higher if either partner was HIV seropositive, 13.2 times higher if the female had trichomoniasis, 2.5 times higher if the female had more than 1 sex partner ever, and decreased with increasing age of the female. In this population, characteristics of males and of females were independently associated with BV.

Evaluating HIV Prevention Programs: Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Antibodies as Biomarker for Sexual Risk Behavior in Young Adults in Resource-Poor Countries.,Behling J.; Chan AK.; Zeh C.; Nekesa C.; Heinzerling L.,"Measuring effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions is challenged by bias when using self-reported knowledge, attitude or behavior change. HIV incidence is an objective marker to measure effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions, however, because new infection rates are relatively low, prevention studies require large sample sizes. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is similarly transmitted and more prevalent and could thus serve as a proxy marker for sexual risk behavior and therefore HIV infection. HSV-2 antibodies were assessed in a sub-study of 70,000 students participating in an education intervention in Western Province, Kenya. Feasibility of testing for HSV-2 antibodies was assessed comparing two methods using Fisher's exact test. Three hundred and ninety four students (aged 18 to 22 years) were randomly chosen from the cohort and tested for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Out of these, 139 students were tested for HSV-2 with ELISA and surveyed for sexual risk behavior and 89 students were additionally tested for HSV-2 with a point-of-contact (POC) test. Prevalence rates were 0.5%, 1.8%, 0.3% and 2.3% for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, respectively. Prevalence of HSV-2 antibodies was 3.4 % as measured by POC test (n=89) and 14.4 % by ELISA (n=139). Specificity of the POC test compared with ELISA was 100%, and the sensitivity only 23.1%. Associations between self-reported sexual behavior and HSV-2 serostatus could not be shown. Associations between self-reported sexual risk behavior and HSV-2 serostatus could not be shown, probably due to social bias in interviews since its transmission is clearly linked. HSV-2 antibody testing is feasible in resource-poor settings and shows higher prevalence rates than other sexually transmitted diseases thus representing a potential biomarker for evaluation of HIV prevention interventions.",2015,,PloS one,10,5,e0128370,,10.1371/journal.pone.0128370,26010772,#1866,Behling 2015,Exclusion reason: 5.

Selenium deficiency is associated with shedding of HIV-1--infected cells in the female genital tract.,Baeten JM.; Mostad SB.; Hughes MP.; Overbaugh J.; Bankson DD.; Mandaliya K.; Ndinya-Achola JO.; Bwayo JJ.; Kreiss JK.,"To assess the relation between selenium deficiency and vaginal or cervical shedding of HIV-1-infected cells. Cross-sectional study of 318 HIV-1 seropositive women in Mombasa, Kenya. Vaginal and cervical swab specimens were tested for the presence of HIV-1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusting for CD4 count and vitamin A deficiency, were used. Selenium deficiency (defined as levels <85 microg/L) was observed in 11% of the study population. In unstratified multivariate analyses, there was no significant association between selenium deficiency and vaginal or cervical shedding. In stratified analyses, however, significant associations became apparent after excluding women with predictors of shedding with strong local effects on the genital tract mucosa. Among women who did not use oral contraceptives and who did not have vaginal candidiasis, selenium deficiency was significantly associated with vaginal shedding (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0--8.8, p =.05).

Ecological and individual level analysis of risk factors for HIV infection in four urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa with different levels of HIV infection.,Auvert B.; Buvé A.; Ferry B.; Caraël M.; Morison L.; Lagarde E.; Robinson NJ.; Kahindo M.; Chege J.; Rutenberg N.; Musonda R.; Laourou M.; Akam E.;  .,"To identify factors that could explain differences in rate of spread of HIV between different regions in sub-Saharan Africa. Cross-sectional study. The study took place in two cities with a relatively low HIV prevalence (Cotonou, Benin and Yaoundé, Cameroon), and two cities with a high HIV prevalence (Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia). In each of these cities, a representative sample was taken of about 1000 men and 1000 women aged 15-49 years. Consenting men and women were interviewed about their socio-demographic background and sexual behaviour; and were tested for HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea infection, and (women only) Trichomonas vaginalis. Analysis of risk factors for HIV infection was carried out for each city and each sex separately. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were obtained by multivariate logistic regression. The prevalence of HIV infection in sexually active men was 3.9% in Cotonou, 4.4% in Yaoundé, 21.1% in Kisumu, and 25.4% in Ndola. For women, the corresponding figures were 4.0, 8.4, 31.6 and 35.1%. High-risk sexual behaviour was not more common in the high HIV prevalence cities than in the low HIV prevalence cities, but HSV-2 infection and lack of circumcision were consistently more prevalent in the high HIV prevalence cities than in the low HIV prevalence cities. In multivariate analysis, the association between HIV infection and sexual behavioural factors was variable across the four cities. Syphilis was associated with HIV infection in Ndola in men [aOR = 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-4.91 and in women (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.6). HSV-2 infection was strongly associated with HIV infection in all four cities and in both sexes (aOR ranging between 4.4 and 8.0). Circumcision had a strong protective effect against the acquisition of HIV by men in Kisumu (aOR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.12-0.52). In Ndola, no association was found between circumcision and HIV infection but sample sizes were too small to fully adjust for confounding. The strong association between HIV and HSV-2 and male circumcision, and the distribution of the risk factors, led us to conclude that differences in efficiency of HIV transmission as mediated by biological factors outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the variation in rate of spread of HIV between the four cities.",2001,Aug,"AIDS (London, England)",15 Suppl 4,,S15-30,,10.1097/00002030-200108004-00003,11686462,#1248,Auvert 2001,Exclusion reason: 4.

"Prevalence of mycoplasma genitalium among women attending sexually transmitted infection clinic in Kumasi, Ghana",Agyarko-Poku T.; Adu Sarkodie Y.; Hene Frimpong E.,"Background: Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) has been identified over the past decade as an aetiological agent of non-gonococci cervicitis in women. A multinational study in among female sex workers in West Africa which included Kumasi and Accra Ghana established Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence of 26.3%. The literature is however silent on prevalence of MG among women in the general population in Ghana. This study sought to determine the current state of affair in women patronising Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. Methods: Specimens for DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) determination, were collected from the vagina and the cervix of 300 women: 150 sex workers (SW) and 150 non-sex workers (NSW), attending Suntreso STI Clinic in Kumasi for the first time, with complaint of vaginal discharge. Socio demographic characteristics of the women, symptoms and signs were recorded. Associations of factors with Mycoplasma genitalium were recorded and adjusted for other risk factors. Results: Ten (10) out of the 300 women representing 3.3% (10/300), were found to have Mycoplasma genitalium; p = 0.000, OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.07-0.87, X2 = 0.27. Prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium in female sex workers was higher (4.7%, 7/150) than non-sex workers (2.0%, 3/150). Younger age (15-29 years, 5.4%, 9/167) was found to be the strongest predictor of Mycoplasma genitalium. Conclusion: The study confirms Mycoplasma genitalium as an aetiological agent of vaginal discharge in women in Kumasi Ghana, conforming to other studies in West Africa with lower prevalence rate. It is possible that the actual rate, in the general population may be low as indicated by even lower rate among high-risk group like sex workers.

Stable relationship: Barrier to partner management of sexually transmitted infections,Agyarko-Poku T.; Adu Sarkodie Y.; Atakorah-Yeboah L.; Wambugu S.,"Background: Effective partner involvement in management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remains one of the major pillars of efficient management of STIs. In clinical practise in Ghana, this has not been very easy to achieve as it behoves on the index patient to bring partners in to the health service provider. This is compounded by the fact that there are no laws to compel practitioner to enforce partner notification and reporting. This study investigates the relationship between the success of partner notification and marital status among patients attending Suntreso STI clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. Methods: Clinical records of Two thousand seven hundred and forty six (2,746; Male - 37.2%, 1022/2746; Female - 62.8%, 1724/2746) patients who sought STI treatment between January 2010 and December 2011 were reviewed. Marital status, gender, notice of notification, response of partner of index patient and diagnosis were recorded. Data was analysed using SPSS Results: Of the 2,746 patients, 34.7% were married, 35.3% were single, 17.1% cohabitating and 12.9% separated/divorced. Partners of 61.3% (1683/2746: Male - 29.0%, 488/1683; Female-71.0%, 1,195) of the index patients responded to the call. Those who responded, were made up of 19.1% (182/953) of the married persons, 58.9%(571/696) of single, 71.1%(334/470) cohabitating and 44.6%(157/354) separated/divorced. Conclusion: Married couples in relatively stable relationships had lower partner reporting rate (19.1%) compared with those in other relations. Married males were more reluctant to report than female counterparts. Misunderstanding and possibility of mistrust among partners may have contributed to lower rates of partner reporting. Higher reporting rate among partners in cohabitating relationships may relate to the feeling of freedom and the ability to easily disengage from the relationship should strife arise.",2013,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,89,"(Wambugu S.)

Statistical modeling of social risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases among female youths in Nigeria,Adebowale A.S.; Titiloye M.; Fagbamigbe A.F.; Akinyemi O.J.,"Introduction: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are preventable, but the social risks factors connected to them are often not understood, particularly by female youths. There has been a dearth of information on the identification of social risk factors influencing STDs among female youths in Nigeria, hence we conducted this study. Methodology: This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, 2008. It focused on female youths aged 15-24 (n=7,736) who ever had sexual intercourse. Data was analyzed using Chi-square and logistic regression models. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 20.2±2.5years. More female youths aged between 20 and 24 years contracted STDs in the last 12 months (2.5%) than those between the ages of 15 and 19 months (1.4%). A year prevalence of STDs among female youths in Nigeria was 2.1%. Socio-demographic factors such as age, education, wealth index, marital status, shared toilet, residence, contraceptive use, and total life-time number of sexual partners were found to be associated risk factors for contracting STDs (p<0.05). Controlling for potential confounding variables at the fifth iteration, the identified predictors of contracting STDs were wealth index, total lifetime number of sexual partners, awareness of HIV/AIDS, and shared toilet facility (p<0.05). Conclusions: The data confirmed the considerable impact of wealth index and awareness of HIV/AIDS as important predictors of STDs acquisition. Providing free condoms, along with teaching the importance of abstinence and improving knowledge of HIV/AIDS, can help to reduce the risk of STDs transmission. © 2013 Adebowale et al.",2013,,Journal of Infection in Developing Countries,7,1,17-27,,,,#3706,Adebowale 2013,Exclusion reason: 8.

Maternal morbidity in the first year after childbirth in Mombasa Kenya; a needs assessment.,Chersich MF.; Kley N.; Luchters SM.; Njeru C.; Yard E.; Othigo MJ.; Temmerman M.,"In sub-Saharan Africa, few services specifically address the needs of women in the first year after childbirth. By assessing the health status of women in this period, key interventions to improve maternal health could be identified. There is an underutilised opportunity to include these interventions within the package of services provided for woman-child pairs attending child-health clinics. This needs assessment entailed a cross-sectional survey with 500 women attending a child-health clinic at the provincial hospital in Mombasa, Kenya. A structured questionnaire, clinical examination, and collection of blood, urine, cervical swabs and Pap smear were done. Women's health care needs were compared between the early (four weeks to two months after childbirth), middle (two to six months) and late periods (six to twelve months) since childbirth. More than one third of women had an unmet need for contraception (39%, 187/475). Compared with other time intervals, women in the late period had more general health symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever and depression, but fewer urinary or breast problems. Over 50% of women in each period had anaemia (Hb <11 g/l; 265/489), with even higher levels of anaemia in those who had a caesarean section or had not received iron supplementation during pregnancy. Bacterial vaginosis was present in 32% (141/447) of women, while 1% (5/495) had syphilis, 8% (35/454) Trichomonas vaginalis and 11% (54/496) HIV infection. Throughout the first year after childbirth, women had high levels of morbidity. Interface with health workers at child health clinics should be used for treatment of anaemia, screening and treatment of reproductive tract infections, and provision of family planning counselling and contraception. Providing these services during visits to child health clinics, which have high coverage both early and late in the year after childbirth, could make an important contribution towards improving women's health.",2009,Nov,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,9,,51,,10.1186/1471-2393-9-51,19891784,#277,Chersich 2009,Exclusion reason: 7.

Prospective study of hormonal contraception and women's risk of HIV infection in South Africa.,Myer L.; Denny L.; Wright TC.; Kuhn L.,"Many women using hormonal contraceptives are also at risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection, but data are mixed on whether hormonal contraception increases women's risk of HIV. We investigated associations between HIV incidence and use of combined oral contraceptives (COC), norethindrone enanthate (NET-EN) or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in a cohort of South African women. Participants were 4200 HIV-negative women aged 35-49 years enrolled into a cervical cancer screening trial. At enrollment, women were tested for sexually transmitted infections and reported on their sexual behaviour and contraceptive use. During the 24 months of follow-up, women reported on their sexual behaviours and contraceptive use and underwent repeat HIV testing. During the 5010 person-years of follow-up, 111 incident HIV infections were observed (HIV incidence, 2.2 infections/100 person-years). At enrollment, 21% of women reported using hormonal contraception, primarily DMPA (14% of all women) or NET-EN (5%). After adjusting for sexual risk behaviours and sexually transmitted infections, the incidence of HIV was similar among women using COC, NET-EN or DMPA compared with women not using any hormonal method [incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 0.65, 0.16-2.66; 0.79, 0.31-2.02 and 0.96, 0.58-1.59, respectively]. There was also no association between increased duration of DMPA use and HIV incidence (P-value for trend, 0.51).

We examined baseline factors associated with enrolling in a contraceptive intravaginal ring study in Kisumu, Kenya and describe notional acceptability (willingness to switch to a contraceptive ring based solely on information received about it). Demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral eligibility screening of women 18-34 years was undertaken. Testing for pregnancy, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was also conducted. We compared enrollment status across groups of categorical predictors using prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates obtained from a log-binomial regression model. Out of 692 women pre-screened April to November 2014, 463 completed screening, and 302 women were enrolled.

However, it decreased gradually to 10% - 20% after introduction of ABC educational campaign, point-of-care testing during outbreaks in 2010, mother-tochild- transmission prevention (MTCTP) since 2003 and increasing number of treated patients and after 2005 global Fund and world Bank introduced free generic antiretroviral payment (e.g. NASCOP) in Kenya. The aim of this study was to determine HIV occurrence in newly tested individuals in distinct hospital voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) and AIDS cases in Bunda, Tanzania. Altogether 14499 patients came at study period to outpatient department (OPD) and inpatient (IPD) units (general, internal unit, paediatric, surgical, and maternity units). These were treated since July 2011 to August 2012, with an average of 1200 - 1300 patients a month (674 - 789 OPD and 363 - 514 IPD). Incidence of new HIV-positive cases, malaria, tuberculosis cases, pneumonia and diarrhoea as well as sexually transmitted diseases (STD) were monthly assessed. Within last 5 years, 1194 new cases of HIV were detected (in 2005 - 2010) and 226 (19%) of these patients receive antiretroviral therapy (ARV), which counts for approximately 20 new treated cases per month (240 a year). Of 1037 - 1210 monthly visits, about 400 - 500 were tested, which is 3 - 4% prevalence, even in sick patients population. Since July 2011, monthly prevalence was 10-15 cases/1000 -1200 patients (1 - 1,5%), which is much less than prevalence reported by government in West Tanzania. Low prevalence of HIV positive patients in Kibara Hospital is constantly decreasing from 8 - 15% as reported by WHO to 3 - 4% in 2005 - 2010 and even to 1,5-3% in 2011/2012. This is probably due to active outreaching and screening policy, access to VCT, free ARV, testing and ABC educational campaign in Tanzania.",2013,,American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,89,5,234,,,,#4221,Mikolasova 2013,Exclusion reason: 3.

Investigating and managing infertility in a low resource setting: Incidence of tubal factor infertility in a rural Zambian population,Bonnett T.J.; Woodfield J.C.,"Objectives Infertility is often regarded as low priority in low resource settings where the birth rate is high. Childlessness has huge social implications for women in such countries and can often lead to stigmatisation, social isolation, domestic violence, mental health issues and relationship breakdown. Infertility is a common presenting complaint at Kalene Mission Hospital, North West Zambia, a partly government-funded hospital serving a rural population. Investigation options are limited by a lack of hormonal assays, limited microscopy services and difficulties in obtaining radio-opaque contrast and X-ray film. A C-arm theatre image intensifier and ultrasound machine are available. We describe an approach to infertility investigation in a low resource setting. All patients presenting with infertility underwent a modified hysterosalpingography (HSG) examination and we report on the incidence of tubal factor infertility in this population. Methods The infertility investigation protocol included history and examination, ultrasound to rule out uterine abnormalities/ ovarian pathology, HIV test, syphilis serology, an HSG and semen analysis if the male partner had no other children. HSG examinations were performed on 28 patients under sedation. Gastrograffin radio-opaque contrast was diluted with saline and injected into the uterine cavity using a spackman cannula. The Carm image intensifier was used for real-time visualisation of the uterine cavity and tubal fill and spill. Results 17/28 patients (61%) presented with primary infertility and 11/28 patients (39%) presented with secondary subfertility. 23/28 patients (82%) had blockage of one or both tubes at HSG. 17/28 patients (61%) had bilateral tubal blockage. Conclusions In view of the limited microscopy services available and the high incidence of tubal blockage all patients presenting with infertility were given a course of antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Tubal surgery and tubal insufflation or flushing have been described in the low resource setting but we felt that the risk of ectopic pregnancy outweighed potential benefits given the long distances that many patients travelled to reach the hospital and frequent delays in seeking medical attention. In couples with one or both tubes patent and normal semen analysis ovulation induction was commenced using tamoxifen as clomiphene was not readily available. Reproductive healthcare programmes in low resource settings should encompass investigation and management of infertility given the significant social implications of childlessness.",2013,,BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,120,"(Woodfield J.C.)

"Sexually transmitted infections among street involved youth in Eldoret, Kenya",Winston S.E.; Chirchir A.K.; Muthoni L.N.; Ayuku D.; Koech J.; Nyandiko W.; Carter E.J.; Braitstein P.,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the acceptability of self-collected swabs for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and describes STI rates among streetinvolved youth in Eldoret, Kenya METHODS: Youth ages 12-21 years in Eldoret, Kenya who spend their days or days and nights on the street, were recruited by convenience sampling. A structured interview was conducted privately followed by phlebotomy and self-collected vaginal/urine (males only) and rectal swabs for STI screening (HSV-2, Syphilis, Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhea (NG) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV)). Verbal and visual instructions for self-collection were provided. Questions regarding self-collected swabs were asked following collection. Descriptive analyses of data were performed by calculating percentages of variables present in the study population. RESULTS: 200 street-involved youth aged 12-21 enrolled, 41% female. 65% reported ever having sex. Only 6% (12/200) reported prior STI symptoms; of those only 7/12 had sought care. 88% of participants underwent phlebotomy, 91% provided self-collected vaginal/urine samples and 92% provided rectal samples. 90% considered self-collecting vaginal swabs and 76% considered self-collecting rectal swabs “very easy” to “neutral.” 83% would use this method again, and 72% preferred future testing via self-collected over provider-collected samples. Only 3 participants reported active symptoms. 27% of all (54% of females) had any STI. 11% of all and 25% of females had more than 1 STI. HSV-2 was most common (17%) followed by Chlamydia (8%). of those with any STI, 9/54 denied any sexual activity. CONCLUSIONS: Street youth are a particularly vulnerable population, engaged in high risk behaviors. Few reported symptoms of STIs or sought care. Screening tests demonstrated that a large percentage had evidence of STIs, HSV and CT being the most common, conditions that are often asymptomatic but can cause increased susceptibility to HIV, and other consequences.

Cervical cancer secondary prevention: POC STI screening and treatment on the ZDFMS integrated mobile HCT/cervical cancer screening program,Chilwesa P.M.; Njobvu P.; Mulenga Y.,"Background and Context: Zambia has one of the World's highest prevalence for both HIV (16% women of reproductive age) and cervical cancer (52.8/100,000 ASR) (GloboCan, Zambia Factsheet).Chlamydia trachomatis infection increases the risk of HPV acquisition or HPV persistence, and repeated CT infections increase the risk of CIN3+ among women with prevalent as well as persistent high-risk HPV infection (Jensen KE, et al). Point of care (POC) STI screening and same-day treatment was introduced, on a trial run, on the already existing integrated mobile HCT and Cervical cancer screening and early treatment (2° prevention) program, with proven strengths of task shifting, telemedicine, and demand creation. Aim: Secondary prevention of Cervical cancer by early treatment of asymptomatic common STIs Strategy/Tactics: Zambia Defence Force Medical Services (DFMS), with support from PCI, trained personnel from the HCT and Cervical cancer screening team on the three STIs (RST, GC, and CT) SOPs and the integration thereof. Positive results would be treated immediately, with adequate partner notification call-up and treatment. Programme/Policy Process: 1,470 women (median age 35) were screened for Cervical cancer and HIV/STIs: Out of these, 119 (8%) VIA+ (including? Cervical cancer) 205 (14%) were positive for STIs [193(94%) asymptomatic, 12 (6%) symptomatic], 275(18.7%) HIV+.

"Determinants of reproductive tract infections among asymptomatic women in Harare, Zimbabwe.",Mbizvo EM.; Msuya SE.; Stray-Pedersen B.; Sundby J.; Chirenje ZM.; Hussain A.,"To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for reproductive tract infections (RTI) among asymptomatic women attending primary health care clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe. A cross sectional study. Prevalent RTI, HIV and socio-demographic data. Two primary health care clinics in Harare. 393 consecutive, consenting women aged 15 to 49 years, presenting at the clinics for antenatal care, family planning, or bringing their children to attend preventive care clinics. More than half of the women had at least one ongoing RTI. Voluntary reporting of symptoms was almost non-existent. Prevalence of HIV was 29.3% and that of classical STIs was 15.4% Trichomoniasis vaginalis, 3.9% syphilis, 3.9% Chlamydia trachomatis and 1.8% Neisseria gonorrhoea. Bacteria vaginosis was diagnosed in 30.3% of the women and candidiasis in 25.4%. Presence of any RTI was significantly associated with lower level of education, sexual debut < 20 years, a non-monogamous partner, and use of a condom during the last sexual encounter. Independent factors associated with cervical infections were young age (< 20 years), being unmarried, current dysuria, warts, clinical signs of purulent or yellowish discharge, lower abdominal pain and cervical friability. Vaginitis was associated with sexual debut or marriage < 20 years, a partner who was a frequent traveller, history of STI, and presence of abnormal vaginal discharge. In view of the high prevalence of RTI and HIV and the low reporting of symptoms by infected women, it is recommended that strategies that improve women's awareness of urogenital symptoms be adopted, along with pro-active inquiry of genital symptoms by the health care workers, and treatment of RTIs, in order to reduce the unnecessary burden of RTIs.",2001,Mar,The Central African journal of medicine,47,3,57-64,,10.4314/cajm.v47i3.8595,11961859,#754,Mbizvo 2001,Exclusion reason: 7.

Changes in the etiology of sexually transmitted diseases in Botswana between 1993 and 2002: Implications for the clinical management of genital ulcer disease,"Paz-Bailey, G.; Rahman, M.; Chen, C.; Ballard, R.; Moffat, H. J.; Kenyon, T.; Kilmarx, P. H.; Totten, P. A.; Astete, S.; Boily, M. C.; Ryan, C.","Background. In recent years, increasing evidence has accumulated that suggests the majority of cases of genital ulcer disease in sub-Saharan Africa are due to viral and not bacterial infections. Although many cross-sectional studies support such a trend, few serial cross-sectional data are available to show the evolution of genital ulcer disease over time. Methods. We surveyed the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among patients with STD symptoms and women recruited from family planning clinics in 3 cities in Botswana in 2002 and compared our findings with those from a survey of a similar population conducted in 1993. Results. The observed proportion of cases of genital ulcer disease due to chancroid decreased from 25% in 1993 to 1% in 2002, whereas the proportion of ulcers due to herpes simplex virus increased from 23% in 1993 to 58% in 2002. Although the proportion of ulcers due to syphilis was similar for both surveys, the rate of positive serologic test results for syphilis among patients with genital ulcer disease decreased from 52% in 1993 to 5% in 2002. During this period, decreases in the prevalence of gonorrhea, syphilis-reactive serologic findings, chlamydial infection, and trichomoniasis were also detected among patients with STDs and women from family planning clinics. These changes remained significant after estimates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. Conclusions. Our findings suggest a decrease in the prevalence of bacterial STDs and trichomoniasis, a reduction in the proportion of ulcers due to bacterial causes, and an increase in the proportion of ulcers due to herpes simplex virus during the period 1993-2002. These changes should be taken into consideration when defining new guidelines for the syndromic management of genital ulcer disease.",2005,Nov,Clinical Infectious Diseases,41,9,1304-1312,WOS:000232356300020,10.1086/496979,,#6082,Paz-Bailey 2005,Exclusion reason: 7.

A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in two cities with a high HIV prevalence (Kisumu in Kenya and Ndola in Zambia) and two cities with a relatively low HIV prevalence (Cotonou in Benin and Yaoundé in Cameroon). In each of these cities, approximately 1000 men and 1000 women, aged 15-49 years, were randomly selected from the general population. Consenting men and women were interviewed and were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis (the latter for women only). In addition, a survey was conducted on a random sample of 300 sex workers in each city. The research instruments, including the questionnaires and the laboratory procedures, were standardized to permit comparison of results.

Despite the pervasiveness of the conflict into every level of society, relief and recovery efforts often target perceived 'at-risk' groups and lack a sound evidence base. METHODS: The Cango Lyec Project is a prospective cohort study of 2500 participants age 13-49 in three districts of Northern Uganda. Participants consented to participate in the study, completing trauma (HTQ), depression (HSCL-25) sociodemographic surveys, and providing blood samples for HIV testing. Three separate multivariable logistic regression models examined a history of abduction and the likelihood of HIV positivity, PTSD, and Depression. RESULTS: Of 2388 participants in the study, 27.4% of men (n=271) and 22.9% of women (n=319) experienced abduction during the conflict. Abducted women reported higher proportions of HIV risk factors than non-abducted women including lifetime sexual abuse (34.2% vs. 7.15%), participation in sex work (2.2% vs. 0.5%), active syphilis (7.2% vs. 4.4%), and experiencing 12 or more traumatic events (32.9% vs. 1.8%). Among men, abductees were more likely to report inconsistent condom use (6.3% vs. 15.6%), to have experienced 12 or more traumatic events (33.1% vs. 1.84%), and to have abused their current sexual partner (19.6% vs. 8.9%). After adjustment, history of abduction was significantly associated with depression (AOR 1.89; 95% CI 1.43-2.49) and PTSD (AOR 2.10; 95% CI 1.56-2.83), but was not significantly associated with HIV infection (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.80-1.47).

Factors associated with HIV infection among females aged 15-24 in Zambia,Cai H.; Barradas D.T.; Gupta S.; Hageman K.; Low A.; Kancheya N.; Sleeman K.; Williams D.B.; Sachathep K.; Patel H.; Chituwo O.; Mulenga L.,"Background: The Zambia Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (ZAMPHIA), a nationally-representative cross-sectional household survey conducted in 2016, found that adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-24 are disproportionately infected with HIV compared to male peers. HIV prevalence was found to be 5.7% (95% CI: 4.9-6.5%) among AGYW, more than three times the prevalence found among males of the same age (1.8%, 95% CI: 1.3-2.3%). Only 40.1% of AGYW who tested positive reported awareness of their status. This analysis explores the demographic, behavioral, and biological factors associated with HIV infection among AGYW using preliminary ZAMPHIA data. Methods: Among 5,205 eligible AGYW household members, 4,587 AGYW provided questionnaire responses (88.1% unweighted), of which 4,165 AGYW provided blood samples (90.8% unweighted), representative of more than 1.66 million AGYW in Zambia. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between HIV infections and demographic, behavioral, and biological variables among AGYW who reported having at least one sexual partner in the past 12 months (n=2,188, unweighted). Figures presented are weighted unless otherwise specified and account for the complex survey design. Results: Two-thirds of AGYW reported having ever had sexual intercourse. Of these, 81.0% reported having had one or more sexual partner in the past 12 months. Variables significantly associated with higher odds of HIV infection included urban residence (referent: rural; AOR[95% CI]=2.3[1.6, 3.4], p=<.0001), having a reactive syphilis test showing past or active infection (referent: nonreactive syphilis test; past syphilis AOR[95% CI]=2.4[1.1, 5.2], p=.022; active syphilis AOR[95% CI]=3.4[1.8, 6.3], p<.0001), and being in the 20-24 year old age group (referent: 15-19 years old; AOR[95% CI]=2.2[1.4, 3.5], p<.001). Conclusion: These findings provide additional evidence for the factors that may require special consideration in Zambia regarding the provision of HIV services for AGYW, like syphilis infection and urban residence. HIV testing in this age group is of particular concern since ZAMPHIA 2016 found that awareness of HIV status among those who tested positive for HIV was less than half of the UNAIDS target for achieving epidemic control. Additional analyses are needed to clarify these associations, explore interaction terms, and examine other factors, like past pregnancy, upon availability of the final ZAMPHIA 2016 dataset.

"Aetiological agents of infective vaginal discharge among women attending a STD clinic in Kumasi, Ghana",Agyarko-Poku T.,"Objective To determine the prevalence of aetiological agents in Infective Vaginal Discharge among women attending a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. Methodology Three hundred (300) women consisting of 150 sex workers (SW) and 150 non-sex workers (NSW), attending the Suntreso STI clinic in Kumasi, with complaint of vaginal discharge were recruited for the study. Specimens for wet mount, pH determination, whiff test, Gram's stains, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected from the vagina and the cervix for microbial identification. The HIV status of the women was also determined by Western Blot Assay. Details regarding socio demographic characteristics of the women, symptoms and signs as well as sexual behaviour were recorded. Associations of these factors with each of the aetiological agent was recorded and adjusted for other risk factors. Result Bacterial vaginosis was the most common cause of infective vaginal discharge (111/300: 37.0%, p =0.000, SW-61/150{40.7%}; NSW-58/150{38.0%} in the women, followed by Candida spp. (99/ 300: 32.7%, p=0.000, SW-41/150{27.3%}; NSW-58/150{38.0%}), Trichomonas vaginalis (20/300: 6.7%, p=0.000) SW-12/150{8.0%; NSW-8/150{5.3%}), Chlamydia trachomatis (9/300: 3.0%, p=0.001 SW-6/150{4.0%}; NSW-3/150{150{2.0%}), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6/300: 2.0%, p=0.014, SW-4/150{2.7%}; NSW-2/150{1.3%}) and Mycoplasma genitalium (10/300, 3.3%, p=0.000, SW-7/150{2.0%}). 11.3% (34/300, 30 sex workers, four non-sex workers) of the women were HIV antibody positive. All of the aetiological agents except Chlamydia trachomatis (p=0.705) were associated with HIV infection. There was no difference in the types of aetiological agent found in sex workers (SW) and non-sex workers (NSW). Prevalence of all the aetiological agents was higher among sex workers except for Candida spp. (27.3%, 41/150 compared with non-sex workers (38.0%, 57/150). Younger age (15-29 years) was found to be the strongest predictor of infection. Conclusion Agents of Bacteria vaginosis, Candida spp. and Trachomonas vaginalis continue to be the most predominant aetiological agents responsible for infective vaginal discharge among women in Kumasi, Ghana, while prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis decline.

Trichomoniasis in womenattending an antiretroviral clinic in South Africa,Dijkmans A.C.; Rukasha I.; Hoosen A.A.,"Background: To determine the rate of Trichomonas vaginalis infection in HIV positive women attending the anti-retroviral clinic at the Tshwane District Hospital, Pretoria and to evaluate conventional diagnostic methods against molecular assays. Methods & Materials: Vaginal specimens wereobtained from consenting women who were attending an anti-retroviral clinic. Trichomonas vaginalis was diagnosed by wet mount microscopy, culture with lnPouch (Biomed Diagnostics, USA) and a commercial PCR assay (Trichomonas vaginalis 240/250 IC, Sacace Biotechnology, Italy; targeting the DNA repeat units of T. vaginalis). Specimens were considered positive for T. vaginalis when positive by wet mount, culture or PCR. Discrepant results were subjected to a realtime PCR assay targeting the beta-tubulin gene. Results: Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained from 95 women, of whom 26 were pregnant. Wet mount microscopy detected 5/95 (5%) infections, while culture was positive in 21/95 (22%) and 28/95 (30%) were PCR positive i.e. PCR identified 7 additional infections. Ten of the 26 (39%) women were infected. Conclusion: This study showed a high infection rate (30%) of T. vaginalis in HIV positivewomenattending a clinic for anti-retroviral therapy. There was a significant difference when molecular assays were used for diagnosis compared to conventional wet mount microscopy and/or culture. The latter is commonly used for diagnosis in state health facilities. This study recommends the use of molecular assays foroptimumdiagnosis of trichomoniasis.

The epidemiology of HIV-1 infection in northern Tanzania: results from a community-based study.,Kapiga SH.; Sam NE.; Mlay J.; Aboud S.; Ballard RC.; Shao JF.; Larsen U.,"We conducted a community-based study to determine the predictors of HIV-1 among women aged 20-44 years (N = 1,418) and their regular male partners (N = 566) from randomly selected households in Moshi, Tanzania. The weighted prevalence of HIV-1 was 10.3% in women and 7% in men. The highest risk of HIV-1 was in subjects whose partners were HIV-1 seropositive in both women (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 26.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 10.74-66.02) and men (AOR = 22.25; 95%CI: 7.06-70.15). Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and Mycoplasma genitalium were also significantly associated with HIV-1. Women with male partners >or=12 years older than themselves had increased risk of HIV-1 (AOR = 1.99; 95%CI: 1.01-7.85). Other predictors of HIV-1 were history of infertility and the number of sex partners in the last three years in women and the age at time of circumcision and history of past sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in male partners. These findings show that HIV-1/STDs were major public health problems among women and their long-term partners in this population. HIV-1 prevention efforts should include promotion of couple's HIV-1 counseling and testing services, control of HSV-2, promotion of safer sexual practices and strategies to reduce the age difference between women and their partners.",2006,May,AIDS care,18,4,379-87,,10.1080/09540120500465012,16809117,#988,Kapiga 2006,Exclusion reason: 6.

Women were tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs; trichomoniasis, syphilis, hepatitis B and C) and for reproductive tract infections (RTIs; candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis (BV)) and were interviewed at baseline and 9 months later. BV was the most prevalent infection, while syphilis was the most common STI with a 9-month incidence of 10.9% in HIV+ women. Only 24.5% of women positive for any RTI/STI contacted their health facility and got treatment. More HIV- women than HIV+ women had had more than one sexual partner and never used condoms during the follow-up period.

"Trends in the relative prevalence of genital ulcer disease pathogens and association with HIV infection in Johannesburg, South Africa, 2007-2015.",Kularatne RS.; Muller EE.; Maseko DV.; Kufa-Chakezha T.; Lewis DA.,"In South Africa, treatment of genital ulcer disease (GUD) occurs in the context of syndromic management. GUD aetiological studies have been conducted in Johannesburg since 2007. We report on GUD pathogen prevalence, sero-prevalence of STI co-infections and aetiological trends among GUD patients presenting to a community-based primary healthcare facility in Johannesburg over a 9-year period. GUD surveys were conducted from January to April each year. Consecutive genital ulcers were sampled from consenting adults. Swab-extracted DNA was tested by multiplex real-time PCR assays for herpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum (TP), Haemophilus ducreyi (HD) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). HSV-positive DNA extracts were further subtyped into HSV-1 and HSV-2 using a commercial PCR assay; CT-positive extracts were tested with an in-house PCR assay specific for serovars L1-L3 (lymphogranuloma venereum). Sera were tested for HIV, HSV-2, and syphilis co-infections. Giemsa-stained ulcer smears were screened for Klebsiella granulomatis by microscopy. Data were analysed with STATATM version 14. Of 771 GUD specimens, 503 (65.2%) had a detectable pathogen: HSV 468 (60.7%); TP 30 (3.9%); CT L1-3 7 (0.9%); HD 4 (0.5%). No aetiological agents were detected in 270 (34.8%) ulcer specimens. Seroprevalence rates were as follows: HIV 61.7%; HSV-2 80.2% and syphilis 5.8%. There was a strong association between GUD pathogen detection and HIV seropositivity (p < 0.001); 68% of cases caused by HSV were co-infected with HIV. There was a significant decline in the relative prevalence of ulcer-derived HSV over time, predominantly from 2013-2015 (p-value for trend = 0.023); and a trend towards a decrease in the HIV seropositivity rate (p-value for trend = 0.209). HSV remains the leading cause of pathogen-detectable GUD in South Africa.

[Feasibility of cervical smear in HIV-positive women living in Chad].,Mortier E.; Doudéadoum N.; Némian F.; Gaulier A.; Kemian M.,"Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancerrelated death in Sub-Saharan African women. HIV-infected women are at increased risk for cervical intraepithelial lesions and invasive cervical cancer. WHO guidelines for screening and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions are regularly actualized. There are no data on cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in Chad. Between August 2013 and May 2015, screening for cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions was proposed to HIV-infected women living in Moundou (Chad). Cytology examination was performed after with Papanicolaou coloration. Three hundred and eleven HIV-seropositive women accepted the screening without refusal. Mean age of the patients was 38 years (95% Confidence Interval: 37.7-39.9). The women declared a mean of 4.1 pregnancies (range: 0-12). The patients had been followed-up for their seropositivity for 8 years (range: 0-25). All were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Of the patients whose results were known (N = 231), 98% had a CD4 lymphocyte nadir count less than 350/mm(3). Cytological results were as follows: normal smear (N = 59; 19%), inflammatory or hemorrhagic smear (N = 139; 44%), low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (N = 58; 19%), high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (N = 28; 9%), epidermoid carcinoma (N = 13; 4%), and uninterpretable smear (N = 14; 5%). The inflammatory lesions were due to cervicitis (N = 54), vaginosis (N = 22), and trichomonas infection (N = 3). The patients' age, CD4 lymphocyte nadir count, and CD4 count at the time of the cervical smear were not different according to the cytological results. Only five patients had a cone biopsy. Three patients deceased during the study of whom two from a gynaecological cancer diagnosed too late. The screening of dysplasia and cervical cancer in HIV-seropositive women is possible in Chad.

Malarial Infection and Curable Sexually Transmitted and Reproductive Tract Infections Among Pregnant Women in a Rural District of Zambia.,Chaponda EB.; Chico RM.; Bruce J.; Michelo C.; Vwalika B.; Mharakurwa S.; Chaponda M.; Chipeta J.; Chandramohan D.,"Malarial infection and curable sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections (STIs/RTIs) are important causes of adverse birth outcomes. Reducing the burden of these infections in pregnancy requires interventions that can be easily integrated into the antenatal care (ANC) package. However, efforts to integrate the control of malarial infection and curable STIs/RTIs in pregnancy have been hampered by a lack of evidence related to their coinfection. Thus, we investigated the prevalence of coinfection among pregnant women of rural Zambia. A prospective cohort study was conducted in Nchelenge District, Zambia, involving 1,086 first ANC attendees. We screened participants for peripheral malarial infection and curable STIs/RTIs (syphilis, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis), and collected relevant sociodemographic data at booking. Factors associated with malarial and STI/RTI coinfection were explored using univariate and multivariate regression models. Among participants with complete results (N = 1,071), 38.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 35.7-41.6) were coinfected with malaria parasites and at least one STI/RTI; 18.9% (95% CI = 16.5-21.2) were infected with malaria parasites only; 26.0% (95% CI = 23.5-28.8) were infected with at least one STI/RTI but no malaria parasites, and 16.4% (95% CI = 14.1-18.6) had no infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women had a higher risk of being coinfected than HIV-uninfected women (odds ratio [OR] = 3.59 [95% CI = 1.73-7.48], P < 0.001). The prevalence of malarial and STI/RTI coinfection was high in this population.

Study Design: A randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind trial was conducted in HIV-negative, nonpregnant women who inserted Carraguard or placebo at least three times a week, including before vaginal sex, for 6 to 12 months. Monthly visits included pelvic examination, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing/treatment and HIV counseling/testing. Acceptability was assessed quarterly. Results: Of 400 women (205 Carraguard, 195 placebo) enrolled, 328 (77%) completed at least 6 months. Incidence of genital epithelial disruption was similar between the Carraguard (13.6 per 100 woman-years) and placebo (21.3 per 100 woman-years) groups (relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.10); there were no significant differences in rates of HIV/STI, though the study was not powered to determine effectiveness.

Couples at risk: HIV-1 concordance and discordance among sexual partners receiving voluntary counseling and testing in Uganda.,Malamba SS.; Mermin JH.; Bunnell R.; Mubangizi J.; Kalule J.; Marum E.; Hu DJ.; Wangalwa S.; Smith D.; Downing R.,"To determine correlates of HIV-1 concordance for couples receiving voluntary HIV counseling and testing. Cross-sectional study of couples receiving voluntary HIV counseling and testing in Kampala, Uganda. An interview and physical examination were conducted for 49 HIV-1-concordant (both partners infected with HIV) and 126 HIV-1-discordant (1 partner infected with HIV and 1 partner HIV negative) couples. Blood samples from all participants were tested for HIV-1 and syphilis serology. CD4 cell count and HIV load were characterized for all HIV-infected persons. Urine samples were tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis using ligase chain reaction. Associations between couples' HIV status and key sociodemographic, behavioral, and biomedical factors were analyzed. Men in HIV-concordant couples were more likely than men in HIV-discordant couples to be living together with their sexual partner (odds ratio [OR], 11.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-53.7; P=0.004), to be uncircumcised (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.1-18.8; P=0.042), and to have higher HIV loads (OR for each log increase, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.0-4.7; P<0.001). Women in HIV-concordant couples were more likely than women in HIV-discordant couples to be living together with their sexual partner (OR, 19.0; 95% CI, 3.8-84.8), to have an uncircumcised male partner (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.6-26.4), to have had a sexually transmitted disease in the 6 months before enrollment (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.9-4.5), and to have higher HIV loads (OR for each log increase, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.2). Several behavioral and biologic risk factors were associated with HIV concordance for couples.

Epidemiological synergy of Trichomonas vaginalis and HIV in Zimbabwean and South African women.,Mavedzenge SN.; Pol BV.; Cheng H.; Montgomery ET.; Blanchard K.; de Bruyn G.; Ramjee G.; Straten Av.,"Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis) is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the world. Despite the coexisting global epidemics of T. vaginalis and HIV, little attention has focused on the emerging evidence that T. vaginalis increases susceptibility to, and potentially transmission of, HIV. We evaluated T. vaginalis infection in the context of a multisite, randomized controlled trial amongst women in South Africa and Zimbabwe, to determine first, if risk of HIV acquisition was increased among women recently infected with T. vaginalis, and second, if risk of T. vaginalis acquisition was increased among women infected with HIV. After controlling for potential confounders, participants infected with T. vaginalis were more likely to test positive for HIV at their following visit, compared to participants uninfected with T. vaginalis (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.05-4.02). Similarly, HIV-positive participants were twice as likely to have acquired T. vaginalis infection at the following visit, compared to HIV-negative participants (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.35-3.32). We found an increased risk of both HIV acquisition associated with T. vaginalis infection and risk of T. vaginalis acquisition associated with HIV infection. This bidirectional relationship represents a potentially important factor in sustaining the HIV epidemic in populations where T. vaginalis is endemic.",2010,Jul,Sexually transmitted diseases,37,7,460-6,,10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181cfcc4b,20562586,#1773,Mavedzenge 2010,Exclusion reason: 3.

"Randomized clinical trial of brief risk reduction counseling for sexually transmitted infection clinic patients in Cape Town, South Africa.",Kalichman SC.; Cain D.; Eaton L.; Jooste S.; Simbayi LC.,"We examined the effects of a brief counseling intervention designed to reduce HIV risk behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among patients receiving STI services in Cape Town, South Africa. After randomization to either a 60-minute risk reduction counseling session or a 20-minute HIV-STI educational session, patients completed computerized sexual behavior assessments. More than 85% of the participants were retained at the 12-month follow-up. There were 24% fewer incident STIs and significant reductions in unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse among participants who received risk reduction counseling relative to members of the control condition. Moderator analyses showed shorter lived outcomes for heavy alcohol drinkers than for lighter drinkers. The results were not moderated by gender. Brief single-session HIV prevention counseling delivered to STI clinic patients has the potential to reduce HIV infections. Counseling should be enhanced for heavier drinkers, and sustained outcomes will require relapse prevention techniques.

Clinical versus laboratory screening for sexually transmitted infections prior to insertion of intrauterine contraception among women living with HIV/AIDS: a randomized controlled trial.,Kakaire O.; Byamugisha JK.; Tumwesigye NM.; Gemzell-Danielsson K.,"Does laboratory testing after syndromic screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) reduce the rate of intrauterine contraception (IUC) removal among women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA)? Additional laboratory testing after syndromic screening for STIs did not affect the likelihood that a woman would remove an IUC immediately or within 1 year of IUC use or the frequency of post-insertion unscheduled clinic visits. In low-risk WLHA, the incidence rate of IUC removal is low with or without laboratory testing. Fear of infectious morbidity remains an obstacle to uptake of IUC by WLHA. The value of laboratory testing after syndromic screening for STI before the insertion of IUC remains uncertain. We enrolled WLHA from 2 September to 6 December 2013 and followed them up to 31 December 2014. After syndromic screening, 703 women free of STIs were randomized to either additional laboratory screening or no additional screening for STI before IUC insertion. The randomization sequence was generated by an independent statistician and randomization numbers placed in opaque sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. All women randomized had an IUC inserted and in all 672 participants completed the 1-year follow-up. The study staff who followed up the participants were blinded to the study allocation groups. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were used to compare the incidence rates of IUC removal, unscheduled clinic attendance and IUC continuation between the two groups. Women eligible to participate were 18-49 years old at study entry, in a relationship with a male partner, wanted to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 year and were undergoing HIV/AIDS care at Mulago Hospital, Uganda. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and up to four follow-up questionnaires until discontinuation of IUC, loss to follow-up or end of study observation after 12 months. The rate of IUC removal was 8.8% (29/331) in the no additional screening group and 8.0% (27/341) in the additional laboratory screening group [IRR 1.1 (95% CI 0.63-1.93)]. Unscheduled clinic attendances were similar in the two groups at 1 year of IUC insertion: 13.6% (45/331) in the no additional screening group and 12.3% (42/241) in the additional laboratory screening group. During the 1-year follow-up, only five women, three from the no additional screening group and two from the additional laboratory screening group, developed pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), as defined by established diagnostic criteria. We were not able to carry out STI risk assessment directly from the men thus women with high-risk partners could have been included in the study and this may be responsible for the lack of a demonstrable effect of additional laboratory screening on incidence rates of IUC removals and unscheduled clinic attendance. The diagnosis of PID was based on clinical signs and symptoms; therefore, subclinical PID could have been missed. Among WLHA, the incidence rate of IUC removal is low and IUC continuation high. Syndromic screening for STIs could be sufficient in indentifying WLHA who are suitable for IUC use. However, our findings are only generalizable to women in HIV/AIDS care who have access to good follow-up.

The Etiology of Genital Ulcer Disease and Coinfections With Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Zimbabwe: Results From the Zimbabwe STI Etiology Study.,Mungati M.; Machiha A.; Mugurungi O.; Tshimanga M.; Kilmarx PH.; Nyakura J.; Shambira G.; Kupara V.; Lewis DA.; Gonese E.; Tippett Barr BA.; Handsfield HH.; Rietmeijer CA.,"In many countries, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are treated syndromically. Thus, patients diagnosed as having genital ulcer disease (GUD) in Zimbabwe receive a combination of antimicrobials to treat syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and genital herpes. Periodic studies are necessary to assess the current etiology of GUD and assure the appropriateness of current treatment guidelines. We selected 6 geographically diverse clinics in Zimbabwe serving high numbers of STI cases to enroll men and women with STI syndromes, including GUD. Sexually transmitted infection history and risk behavioral data were collected by questionnaire and uploaded to a Web-based database. Ulcer specimens were obtained for testing using a validated multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) assay for Treponema pallidum (TP; primary syphilis), Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid), LGV-associated strains of Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2. Blood samples were collected for testing with HIV, treponemal, and nontreponemal serologic assays. Among 200 GUD patients, 77 (38.5%) were positive for HSV, 32 (16%) were positive for TP, and 2 (1%) were positive for LGV-associated strains of C trachomatis. No H ducreyi infections were detected. No organism was found in 98 (49.5%) of participants. The overall HIV positivity rate was 52.2% for all GUD patients, with higher rates among women compared with men (59.8% vs 45.2%, P < 0.05) and among patients with HSV (68.6% vs 41.8%, P < 0.0001). Among patients with GUD, 54 (27.3%) had gonorrhea and/or chlamydia infection. However, in this latter group, 66.7% of women and 70.0% of men did not have abnormal vaginal or urethral discharge on examination. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of GUD in our survey, followed by T. pallidum. No cases of chancroid were detected. The association of HIV infections with HSV suggests high risk for cotransmission; however, some HSV ulcerations may be due to HSV reactivation among immunocompromised patients. The overall prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia was high among patients with GUD and most of them did not meet the criteria for concomitant syndromic management covering these infections.",2018,01,Sexually transmitted diseases,45,1,61-68,,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000694,29240636,#1800,Mungati 2018,Exclusion reason: 7.

Molecular techniques have become the standard for their detection, and due to the frequency of co-infections, these tests can detect both agents and can be used on urine samples, vaginal swabs, or endocervical samples. In developing countries, the use of these molecular techniques is very limited and there is a need for evaluations of these techniques to be done. Methodology: A total of 181 samples were tested with the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay and compared with the Roche Cobas Amplicor CT/NG assay. Specimens were collected from the key population of men having sex with men (urine, n = 60), female sex workers (genital swabs, n = 60) and from women visiting the laboratory for a gynecological checkup (urine, n = 60 and endocervical samples, n = 61). Results: The agreement between the two techniques was 98.90% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.98. A sensitivity of 93.3%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 93.3% were found for both Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

"The prevalence, incidence and risk factors of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection among pregnant Zimbabwean women followed up nine months after childbirth",Munjoma M.W.; Kurewa E.N.; Mapingure M.P.; Mashavave G.V.; Chirenje M.Z.; Rusakaniko S.; Hussain A.; Stray-Pedersen B.,"Background: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the leading cause of genital ulcer disease worldwide. The virus can be transmitted to neonates and there are scarce data regarding incidence of HSV-2 among women in pregnancy and after childbirth. The aim of this study is to measure the incidence and risk factors for HSV-2 infection in women followed for 9 months after childbirth.Methods: Pregnant women were consecutively enrolled late in pregnancy and followed at six weeks, four and nine months after childbirth. Stored samples were tested for HSV-2 at baseline and again at nine months after childbirth and HSV-2 seropositive samples at nine months after childbirth (seroconverters) were tested retrospectively to identify the seroconversion point.Results: One hundred and seventy-three (50.9%) of the 340 consecutively enrolled pregnant women were HSV-2 seronegative at baseline. HSV-2 incidence rate during the 10 months follow up was 9.7 (95% CI 5.4-14.4)/100 and 18.8 (95% CI 13.9-26.1)/100 person years at risk (PYAR) at four months and nine months after childbirth respectively. Analysis restricted to women reporting sexual activity yielded higher incidence rates. The prevalence of HSV-2 amongst the HIV-1 seropositive was 89.3%. Risk factors associated with HSV-2 seropositivity were having other sexual partners in past 12 months (Prevalence Risk Ratio (PRR) 1.8 (95% CI 1.4-2.4) and presence of Trichomonas vaginalis (PRR 1.7 95% CI 1.4-2.1).

There are no data on the prevalence of rectal or pharyngeal infections among women. We evaluate the use of dry swabs by Roche 4800 CT/NG and the PRESTO-PLUS to determine the prevalence in three anatomic locations of chlamydial and gonococcal infections in African women. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 604 women visiting 25 randomly selected primary healthcare (PHC) facilities. Participants were recruited between November 2011 and February 2012. Setting: PHC facilities across rural Mopani District in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Participants: Women aged 18-49 years who reported at least one sex act in the past 6 months were eligible.

Methods: We collected 970 urine samples from HIV/AIDS patients attending two different hospitals in southeast Nigeria. Samples were processed by microscopy and cultural methods. Results: Out of the 970 screened, 355 (36.60%) were positive for T. vaginalis. Subjects with the least CD4+ count in the range of 40-140 cells/mL had the highest number of positive samples (180, 50.70%), while those in the range of 480-580 cells/mL had the least value (2, 0.56%). Those in the rural areas had a higher number of positive samples (155, 38.75%) than their urban counterparts (200, 35.09%) with respect to the total number examined in each group but this was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Out of the 355 positive cases, the university undergraduate students' group had the highest percentage incidence of 53.00% followed by the low-income group with 47.08%. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the occurrence of T. vaginalis increases with decrease in the CD4+ counts in HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria.

Sexually transmitted disease and HIV prevalence and risk factors in concentrated and generalized HIV epidemic settings,Caceres C.F.; Celentano D.D.; Coates T.J.; Hartwell T.D.; Kasprzyk D.; Kelly J.A.; Kozlov A.P.; Pequegnat W.; Rotheram-Borus M.J.; Solomon S.; Woelk G.; Wu Z.,"BACKGROUND: In many developing countries, the threat of nascent HIV epidemics expanding rapidly requires immediate and appropriate HIV prevention activities. Inexpensive and sustainable interventions are especially relevant in resource-constrained environments. In 2001, we assessed the prevalence and behavioral risk of sexually transmitted disease (STD) and HIV among at-risk populations in five developing countries in preparation for a community-randomized controlled trial, the NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial. METHODS: Using a standardized protocol, more than 1000 participants in each country (China, India, Peru, Russia, and Zimbabwe) were selected by random sampling methods, completed a behavioral risk assessment, and provided biological specimens using a common laboratory protocol. Sample characteristics were studied within each country, and risk factors for HIV/STD acquisition were evaluated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: HIV rates were low (< 1%) in China, India, Peru, and Russia but were high (26%) in rural Zimbabwe. STDs were generally twice as common in women as men, and serological evidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection was the most frequently detected STD. Behavioral data showed high rates of multiple partners in the Russian sample, and very low condom use rates in India and China. Among participants who reported ever having sex, female sex and having two or more sex partners were the factors most frequently associated with an increased risk of prevalent STD. CONCLUSION: Behavioral or biological risks were of sufficient magnitude in the locations selected in China, Russia, and Zimbabwe to implement the community-based randomized trial.

"A study on usefulness of a set of known risk factors in predicting maternal syphilis infections in three districts of Western Province, Zambia",Sakala J.; Chizuni N.; Nzala S.,"Introduction: Despite roll-out of cost-effective point-of-care tests, less than half antenatal attendees in rural western Zambia are screened for syphilis. This study formulated a clinical, risk-based assessment criteria and evaluated its usefulness as a non-biomedical alternative for identifying high-risk prenatal cases. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of antenatal clinic attendees in Kaoma, Luampa and Nkeyema districts to collect data on exposure to nine pre-selected syphilis risk factors. These factors were classified into major and minor factors based on their observed pre-study association strengths to maternal syphilis. Clinical disease was defined as exposure to either two major factors, one major with two minor factors or three minor factors. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the clinical protocol were then calculated in comparison to rapid plasmin reagin results. Results: The observed syphilis prevalence was 9.3% (95% CI: 7.4 - 11.6%) and the overall sensitivity of the study criteria was 62.3% with positive predictive value of 72.9%. Sensitivities of individual case-defining categories were even lower; from 17.4% to 33.3%.

Sexually transmitted infections and associated socio-demographic and behavioural factors in women seeking primary care suggest Madagascar's vulnerability to rapid HIV spread.,Behets F.; Andriamiadana J.; Rasamilalao D.; Ratsimbazafy N.; Randrianasolo D.; Dallabetta G.; Cohen M.,"To examine sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and associated socio-demographic and behavioural factors in women seeking care for genital discharge syndrome in Antananarivo, Madagascar. One thousand and sixty-six consecutive symptomatic women were interviewed and examined; bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis (TV), cervical infection (CI) due to chlamydial or gonococcal infections, and syphilis seroreactivity were determined by laboratory diagnosis. Associations between STIs and individual characteristics were evaluated using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. The prevalence of BV, TV, CI, and syphilis seroreactivity was, respectively, 85%, 16%, 49%, 16% in 94 prostitutes; 70%, 18%, 30%, 13% in 96 occasional sex traders; and 53%, 24%, 17%, and 4% in 876 general women.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection and human immunodeficiency virus acquisition in African women.,Van Der Pol B.; Kwok C.; Pierre-Louis B.; Rinaldi A.; Salata RA.; Chen PL.; van de Wijgert J.; Mmiro F.; Mugerwa R.; Chipato T.; Morrison CS.,"Trichomoniasis vaginalis is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide, with a particularly high prevalence in regions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) endemicity. However, its impact as a cofactor for HIV acquisition is poorly understood. Samples from 213 women who experienced HIV seroconversion (cases) during a longitudinal study involving 4450 women in Uganda and Zimbabwe were matched with samples from HIV-uninfected women (controls). All samples underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for Trichomonas vaginalis DNA. For cases, analyzed samples were from the visit in which HIV seroconversion was detected and the visit preceding detection of seroconversion; for controls, one analyzed sample was from the visit matched by follow-up duration to the cases' seroconversion visit, and the other sample was from the visit immediately preceding the matched visit. The prevalence of T. vaginalis infection before HIV infection was 11.3% in cases and 4.5% in controls (P = .002). In multivariable analysis controlling for hormonal contraception, other STIs, behavioral, and demographic factors, the adjusted odds ratio for HIV acquisition was 2.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-6.00) for T. vaginalis-positive cases. The presence of behavioral risk factors for HIV infection, study recruitment from a referral population at high-risk for HIV, primary sex partner-associated risk for HIV infection, and herpes simplex virus type 2 seropositivity were also predictive of incident HIV infection. T. vaginalis infection is strongly associated with an increased risk for HIV infection in this general population of African women.

Etiology of genital ulcer disease and association with human immunodeficiency virus infection in two tanzanian cities.,Ahmed HJ.; Mbwana J.; Gunnarsson E.; Ahlman K.; Guerino C.; Svensson LA.; Mhalu F.; Lagergard T.,"The etiological agent is usually not established in cases of genital ulcer disease (GUD) in Tanzania, since diagnosis and treatment of this disease are based mainly on clinical rather than microbiologic parameters. GUD increases the risk of infection with HIV. However, the association between specific GUD infections and HIV infection has not been fully investigated. The goal was to determine the etiology of GUD and the prevalence of HIV infection in patients with GUD in urban areas of Tanzania. A total of 102 clinical specimens were collected from 52 and 50 patients with GUD in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively, and from 93 patients with genital discharge in a cross-sectional study. Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to identify either a single target DNA or all three DNAs of the major causes of GUD: Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema palladum and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The sera from all patients were tested for antibodies to HIV and T palladum. In Dar es Salaam, DNA from HSV-2, and was detected in 63%, 13%, and 2%, respectively, of the 52 genital ulcer specimens. The corresponding figures in Mbeya were 34%, 10%, and 0% of 50 specimens. Overall, 9% of the 102 patients with GUD were infected with both HSV-2 and, and 39/102 genital ulcer specimens (38%) were negative for the DNA of all three pathogens. The HIV infection rates among GUD patients were 46% and 52% in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively; among the non-GUD patients, the corresponding rates were 35% and 45%, respectively. The HIV infection rate in Dar es Salaam was significantly higher among women (11/14; 78%) than among men (13/38; 34%) (P = 0.004). Among the HIV-seropositive GUD patients, 71% and 46% (P < 0.003) were coinfected with HSV-2 in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively. Furthermore, women with HSV-2 in Dar es Salaam were significantly more likely to be HIV-infected than men (60% versus 39%; P<or= 0.006). antibodies were detected in 27 (26%) of the 102 GUD patients and 16 (17%) of the 93 non-GUD patients.

"Efficacy of voluntary HIV-1 counselling and testing in individuals and couples in Kenya, Tanzania, and Trinidad: a randomised trial. The Voluntary HIV-1 Counseling and Testing Efficacy Study Group.","","Our aim was to determine the efficacy of HIV-1 voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) in reducing unprotected intercourse among individuals and sex-partner couples in Nairobi (Kenya), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), and Port of Spain (Trinidad). Individual or couple participants were randomly assigned HIV-1 VCT or basic health information. At first follow-up (mean 7.3 months after baseline) health-information participants were offered VCT and all VCT participants were offered retesting. Sexually transmitted infections were diagnosed and treated at first follow-up. The second follow-up (mean 13.9 months after baseline) involved only behavioural assessment, and all participants were again offered VCT. 3120 individuals and 586 couples were enrolled. The proportion of individuals reporting unprotected intercourse with non-primary partners declined significantly more for those receiving VCT than those receiving health information (men, 35% reduction with VCT vs 13% reduction with health information; women, 39% reduction with VCT vs 17% reduction with health information), and these results were maintained at the second follow-up. Individual HIV-1-infected men were more likely than uninfected men to reduce unprotected intercourse with primary and non-primary partners, whereas HIV-1-infected women were more likely than uninfected women to reduce unprotected intercourse with primary partners. Couples assigned VCT reduced unprotected intercourse with their enrolment partners significantly more than couples assigned health information, but no differences were found in unprotected intercourse with non-enrolment partners. Couples in which one or both members were diagnosed with HIV-1 were more likely to reduce unprotected intercourse with each other than couples in which both members were uninfected. These changes were replicated by those in the health-information group diagnosed with HIV-1 at first follow-up.

Low effectiveness of syndromic treatment services for curable sexually transmitted infections in rural South Africa.,White RG.; Moodley P.; McGrath N.; Hosegood V.; Zaba B.; Herbst K.; Newell M.; Sturm WA.; Hayes RJ.,"Syndromic sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment remains a cost-saving HIV prevention intervention in many countries in Africa. We estimate the effectiveness of syndromic treatment for curable STIs in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and the trend in STI prevalences before and after the introduction of syndromic treatment in 1995. Data were available from various clinical studies, surveys of public and private health providers, the general population and women attending antenatal, family planning and child immunisation clinics in rural northern KwaZulu-Natal between 1987 and 2004. Overall effectiveness was defined as the estimated proportion of the annual number of symptomatic curable STI episodes cured by syndromic treatment based on separate estimates for six curable STI aetiologies by gender. Median overall effectiveness was 13.1% (95% CI 8.9 to 17.8%) of symptomatic curable STI episodes cured. Effectiveness increased to 25.0% (95% CI 17.3 to 33.8%), 47.6% (95% CI 44.5 to 50.8%) or 14.3% (95% CI 9.9 to 19.4%) if 100% treatment seeking, 100% correct treatment provision or 100% cure were assumed, respectively. Time-trends were difficult to assess formally but there was little evidence of decreasing STI prevalences. Including incurable but treatable herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 ulcers in the effectiveness calculation would halve the proportion of ulcers cured or correctly treated, but this reduction could be entirely countered by including episodic antiviral treatment in the national guidelines. Overall effectiveness of syndromic treatment for curable STIs in rural KwaZulu-Natal remains low and there is little evidence of reduced curable STI prevalences. As syndromic treatment is likely to be a cost-saving HIV prevention intervention in South Africa, innovative strategies are urgently needed to increase rates of treatment seeking and correct treatment provision.",2008,Dec,Sexually transmitted infections,84,7,528-34,,10.1136/sti.2008.032011,18708485,#758,White 2008,Exclusion reason: 8.

Ten community clusters were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. All consenting residents aged 15-59 years were enrolled; visited in the home every 10 months; interviewed; asked to provide biological samples for assessment of HIV-1 infection and STDs; and were provided with mass treatment (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole in the intervention group, vitamins/anthelmintic drug in the control).

Semiparametric regression models were used to investigate the bivariate associations between these factors and the birth cohorts. HIV seroconversion rates were also estimated by birth cohorts. The prevalence of HIV-1 infection at the screening visit was lowest (20.0%) among the oldest (born before 1960) cohorts, while the highest prevalence was observed among those born between 1975 and 79. Level of education increased across the birth cohorts while the median age at first sexual experience declined among those born after 1975 compared to those born before 1975. Only 33.03% of the oldest group reported ever using a condom while engaging in vaginal sex compared to 73.68% in the youngest group; however, HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence rates were significantly higher among younger women compared to older women. These findings clearly suggest that demographic and sexual risk behaviours are differentially related to the birth cohorts. Significantly high HIV and STI incidence rates were observed among the younger group. Although the level of education increased, early age at sexual debut was more common among the younger group.

Correlates of Sexually Transmitted Infections Among South African Women Using Individual- and Community-Level Factors: Results from Generalized Additive Mixed Models.,Wand H.; Morris N.; Dassaye R.; Reddy T.; Ramjee G.,"South Africa has the highest burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in the world. There is also growing evidence that an individual's risk of contracting HIV is increased by the presence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The primary objective of this study was to examine the association between the prevalence of STIs in a cohort of South African women who enrolled in HIV prevention trials (2002-2012). The current study linked the individual factors with the community-level characteristics using geo-referencing. These multi-level data were analyzed in generalized additive mixed models settings. In the multivariate logistic regression model, younger age (odds ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% CI 3.20, 5.77 and OR 2.72, 95% CI 2.02, 3.66 for age < 25 and 25-29, respectively); being single/not cohabiting (OR 4.57, 95% CI 3.18, 6.53), two + sex partners (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18,1.80); parity < 2 (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.53, 2.72), parity = 2 (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.37, 2.48), and using injectables (contraceptive) (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.13, 2.06) were all significantly associated with increased prevalence of STIs. Women who resided in the communities with high proportions of female headed-households were also significantly at higher risk for STIs (OR 1.20, p = .0025). Because these factors may reflect characteristics of the larger groups who share similar cultural norms and social environments, they can provide considerable insight into the spread of STIs. Prevention strategies based on individual and community-level drivers of STIs are likely to be the most effective means of targeting and reaching those at greatest risk of infection. This strategy has the potential to play a significant role in the epidemic's trajectory.",2019,Feb,Archives of sexual behavior,,,,,10.1007/s10508-018-1315-3,30767180,#813,Wand 2019,Exclusion reason: 3.

A prospective cohort study was undertaken to assess site suitability for microbicide efficacy studies. Study objectives included assessing sites' ability to recruit and retain high-risk women with the appropriate HIV incidence rates needed to conduct microbicide efficacy studies. Nine hundred fifty-eight consenting women were enrolled and followed for up to 1 year. Demographic, behavioral, laboratory, and clinical data were collected to determine the incidence rates of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy. Accrual was completed in 6.3, 6.7, 7.1, and 8.3 months in Durban, Hlabisa, Moshi, and Lusaka, respectively. The highest month 12 participant retention rate was recorded in Durban (97%), followed by Hlabisa (94%), Moshi (86%), and Lusaka (93%). Mean overall age of enrolled participants was 28.6 years (ranging from 27.0 to 32.2 years) across sites. Despite condom counseling, rates of condom use were slightly lower at study end. Pregnancy incidence in the study as a whole was 20.2 per 100 women-years (wy). Overall HIV prevalence was 32.5%, and overall HIV incidence was 3.8 per 100 wy (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6 to 5.2). HIV incidence per site was 5.3 per 100 wy in Durban (95% CI: 2.7 to 9.2), 6.2 per 100 wy in Hlabisa (95% CI: 3.4 to 10.5); 2.6 per 100 wy in Lusaka (95% CI: 1.0 to 5.8), and 1.4 per 100 wy in Moshi (95% CI: 0.3 to 4.0). Preparatory studies provide accurate local estimates of HIV incidence, recruitment and retention rates, and behavioral characteristics of targeted populations for large-scale clinical trials.

Comparison of lavage and swabs for the collection of genital ulcer specimens to measure HIV RNA shedding,"Paz-Bailey, G.; Sternberg, M.; Lewis, D. A.; Cutler, E.; Vos, M.; Ballard, R.; Puren, A.","Background: The optimum collection procedure for the evaluation of HIV-1 burden in ulcer secretions has not been well defined. Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare ulcer swabs and ulcer lavages for the detection and quantitation of HIV-1 RNA in genital ulcers. Study design: A convenience sample of the first 84 HIV-positive participants in a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of acyclovir episodic treatment among men with genital ulcer disease were included in this evaluation. At baseline, participants were screened for HIV, syphilis and HSV-2 by serology and for ulcer etiology by PCR. Ulcer specimens were collected by using (1) a non-traumatic washing procedure with 10 ml of PBS, and (2) sterile dry swabs. Ulcer samples were tested with HIV-1 Amplicor 1.5 Ultra Sensitive Assay with a lower threshold of 50 copies/ml. Results: Of ulcer samples 35 (41.7%) had HIV detected by ulcer lavage and 32 (38.1%) by swabs (p = 0.68). Overall, 45 (53.6%) were positive by one or both methods. The overall proportion of agreement was 73% (61/84). The chance-corrected proportion of agreement was 0.46 (95% Cl: 0.26. 0.65) as estimated by the Kappa statistic. The log mean viral load from lavages (1.49 log(10) copies/ml, 95% Cl: 1.17-1.81) did not differ significantly from that of swabs (1.41 log(10) copies/ml, 95% Cl: 1.16-1.71) (p = 0.29) with a mean difference of 0.08 log copies/ml (SD 0.96).

Prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases among female patients presenting with hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus infections in a Nigerian teaching hospital,Onigbogi O.; Ojo O.,"Objectives: The prevalence of HIV infection has been on the increase in Nigeria in recent times. HIV-positive patients in our setting sometimes have hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection co-existing in them. Female patients are sometimes at particular risk because of the co-existence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with these two viral infections. The aim of the study was to determine prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among female patients attending the clinic in a Nigerian teaching hospital. The clinic also serves as the reference centre for STIs in our region of the country. Methods: A retrospective review of 221 case notes of human immunodeficiency (HIV)-positive female patients who had been found to also have HBV infection from January 2001 to December 2007 were analyzed by utilising an on-going observational database at the STI clinic. Records of sexually transmitted diseases were based on clinical assessment and laboratory diagnosis as recorded in the case notes. Rate ratios, comparing prevalence rates (number of infections among the women surveyed) were calculated. Results: The age of the women surveyed ranged from 18 to 54 years. Twenty-two (10%) of the patients were found to have clinical and laboratory evidence of several other STIs co-existing. Fifty patients (38%) had clinical and laboratory evidence of single-occuring STIs. Sixteen respondents (31%) had gonorrhoea infection, 14 (29%) had chlamydiasis, 13 (25%) had candida infection while 7 respondents (13%) had trichomoniasis. The survival rate among women with STIs with HIV and HBV co-infection rose from 2.28 to 3.12 in the last 2 years of the review (Rate ratio = 3.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.31-7.44; p = 0.0002). Conclusion: There was been a significant rise in the incidence of co-existing multiple STIs in the years 2005 and 2006. This coincides with the introduction anti-retroviral drugs in the hospital with greater survival rates and increased attendance and testing. Care providers should therefore be more vigilant for co-existing STIs and more aggressive in their management especially among HIV-positive women because of the peculiar nature of such infections when they also co-exist with HBV.",2009,,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,15,"(Onigbogi O.; Ojo O.)

We analysed data from women participating in a phase III vaginal diaphragm trial conducted in two communities in Durban, South Africa from 2003 to 2006. A total of 3492 women were screened and 1485 women meeting the respective study eligibility criteria were enrolled. T vaginalis infection was determined at the initial screening visit and at quarterly visits among the enrolled women. Sexual behaviour and sociodemographic data were collected as per the study protocol. Combined data were analysed using STATA V.10.0. At baseline, prevalence of infection was 6.5%. The overall incident rate was estimated to be 8.6/100 women-years. Prevalent T vaginalis infection was associated with having a concurrent chlamydial infection and incident infections were associated with increased number of sex partners. T vaginalis infection was found to be relatively high among this cohort of women.

Symptomatic vaginal discharge is a poor predictor of sexually transmitted infections and genital tract inflammation in high-risk women in South Africa.,Mlisana K.; Naicker N.; Werner L.; Roberts L.; van Loggerenberg F.; Baxter C.; Passmore JA.; Grobler AC.; Sturm AW.; Williamson C.; Ronacher K.; Walzl G.; Abdool Karim SS.,"Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is a public health priority, particularly in regions where the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is high. In most developing countries, STIs are managed syndromically. We assessed the adequacy of syndromic diagnosis of STIs, compared with laboratory diagnosis of STIs, and evaluated the association between STI diagnosis and the risk of HIV acquisition in a cohort of high-risk women. HIV-uninfected high-risk women (n = 242) were followed for 24 months. Symptoms of STIs were recorded, and laboratory diagnosis of common STI pathogens was conducted every 6 months. Forty-two cytokines were measured by Luminex in cervicovaginal lavage specimens at enrollment. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was evaluated monthly. Only 12.3% of women (25 of 204) who had a laboratory-diagnosed, discharge-causing STI had clinically evident discharge. Vaginal discharge was thus a poor predictor of laboratory-diagnosed STIs (sensitivity, 12.3%; specificity, 93.8%). Cervicovaginal cytokine concentrations did not differ between women with asymptomatic STIs and those with symptomatic STIs and were elevated in women with asymptomatic STIs, compared with women with no STIs or bacterial vaginosis. Although laboratory-diagnosed STIs were associated with increased risk of HIV infection (hazard ratio, 3.3 [95% confidence interval, 1.5-7.2)], clinical symptoms were not.

We assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the United States. Methods: Genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from 46 US women (36 HIV-infected, 10 HIV-uninfected) and 40 Rwandan women (18 HIV-infected, 22 HIV-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) Nugent scores. Species of Lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. Prevalence of genera and Lactobacillus species were compared using Fisher's exact tests. Results: Overall the seven most prevalent genera were Lactobacillus (74%), Prevotella (56%), Gardnerella (55%), Atopobium (42%), Sneathia (37%), Megasphaera (30%), and Parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing Rwandan to US women, except for Megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). Additionally, Rwandan women had higher frequencies of Mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and Eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of Lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and Allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with US women. The prevalence of Mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in HIV-infected Rwandan women (39%), compared to HIV-infected US women (6%), HIV-uninfected Rwandan (9%) and US (10%) women.

Risk factors of sexually transmitted infections among migrant and non-migrant sexual partnerships from rural South Africa.,Zuma K.; Lurie MN.; Williams BG.; Mkaya-Mwamburi D.; Garnett GP.; Sturm AW.,"In October 1998, cohorts of circular migrant men and their non-migrant sexual partners, and non-migrant men and their non-migrant sexual partners from rural South Africa were recruited and followed-up every 4 months until October 2001. At each visit, information on sociodemographic, sexual behaviour, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV was collected. In total, 553 individuals aged between 18 and 69 years were recruited. A man and his sexual partner(s) form a sexual partnership. Migration status, age, marital status, age at sexual debut, recent sexual partners and HIV status were found to be important determinants of STI. The risk of STI varies (sigma2 = 1.45, P < 0.001) significantly across sexual partnerships even after controlling for important determinants. The variance implies substantial correlation (0.59) between members of the same sexual partnership. Ignoring this correlation leads to incorrect inference.

Prospective cohort study. Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya, between September 2004 and April 2005. Sixty eight mothers with advanced HIV disease (WHO clinical stage 3 and 4) and 68 HIV negative pregnant mothers. Mothers with advanced HIV disease were more likely to be anaemic (55% vs. 16% p < 0.001), to have sexually transmitted diseases (56% vs. 15%, p = 0.004), to have chorioamnionitis (14.8% vs. 2%, p = 0.004), to develop preterm premature rupture of membranes (31% vs. 9%, p < 0.001), to have puerperal pyrexia (16% vs. 2%, p = 0.032) an to die (5% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.028) compared to HIV negative mothers. The mean gestational age at deliver was lower in mothers with advanced HIV disease compared to the seronegative counterparts (73% vs. 32%, delivery <37 weeks, p < 0.001). Infants of mothers with advanced HIV disease compared to infants of seronegative mothers were more likely to be low birth weight infants (58% vs. 21%, p < 0.001), stillborn (4% vs. 2%, p = 0.308) and to have low Apgar scores (28% vs. 12%, Apgar score < 4 at 5 minutes p = 0.02).

The epidemiology of trichomoniasis in women in four African cities.,Buvé A.; Weiss HA.; Laga M.; Van Dyck E.; Musonda R.; Zekeng L.; Kahindo M.; Anagonou S.; Morison L.; Robinson NJ.; Hayes RJ.;  .,"To describe the epidemiology of Trichomonas vaginalis infection and its association with HIV infection, in women in four African cities with different levels of HIV infection. Cross-sectional study, using standardized methods, including a standardized questionnaire and standardized laboratory tests, in four cities in sub-Saharan Africa: two with a high prevalence of HIV infection (Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia), and two with a relatively low prevalence of HIV (Cotonou, Benin and Yaoundé, Cameroon). In each city, a random sample of about 2000 adults aged 15-49 years was taken. Consenting men and women were interviewed about their socio-demographic characteristics and their sexual behaviour, and were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, and (women only) T. vaginalis infection. Risk factor analyses were carried out for trichomoniasis for each city separately. Multivariate analysis, however, was only possible for Yaoundé, Kisumu and Ndola. The prevalence of trichomoniasis was significantly higher in the high HIV prevalence cities (29.3% in Kisumu and 34.3% in Ndola) than in Cotonou (3.2%) and Yaoundé (17.6%). Risk of trichomoniasis was increased in women who reported more lifetime sex partners. HIV infection was an independent risk factor for trichomonas infection in Yaoundé [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9-3.7] and Kisumu (adjusted OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.7), but not in Ndola. A striking finding was the high prevalence (40%) of trichomonas infection in women in Ndola who denied that they had ever had sex. Trichomoniasis may have played a role in the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and may be one of the factors explaining the differences in levels of HIV infection between different regions in Africa. The differences in prevalence of trichomoniasis between the four cities remain unexplained, but we lack data on the epidemiology of trichomoniasis in men.

"Understanding the uneven spread of HIV within Africa: comparative study of biologic, behavioral, and contextual factors in rural populations in Tanzania and Zimbabwe.",Boerma JT.; Gregson S.; Nyamukapa C.; Urassa M.,"Large differences in the spread of HIV have been observed within sub-Saharan Africa. The goal was to identify factors that could explain differences in the spread of HIV within sub-Saharan African populations. Ecologic comparison of data from population-based surveys in high and relatively low HIV prevalence rural areas in Zimbabwe, Manicaland, and Tanzania, Kisesa. HIV prevalence in Manicaland and Kisesa was 15.4% and 5.3% in men aged 17-44 years and 21.1% and 8.0% in women aged 15-44 years (odds ratios, 3.3 and 3.1, respectively). Marriage is later, spatial mobility more common, cohabitation with marital partners less frequent, education levels are higher, and male circumcision is less common in Manicaland. However, adjustment for differences in these factors increased the odds ratios for HIV infection in Manicaland versus Kisesa to 6.9 and 4.8 for men and women, respectively. Sexually transmitted infection levels were similar, but syphilis was only common in Kisesa. Respondents in Kisesa started sex earlier and reported more sexual partners. Age differences between partners were similar in the 2 locations. Substantial differences exist between the contemporary sociodemographic profiles of rural Manicaland and Kisesa. However, these differences did not translate into measurable differences in the biologic or behavioral factors for which data were available and did not explain the much higher HIV prevalence found in Manicaland.

Variations of HIV and STI prevalences within communities neighbouring new goldmines in Tanzania: importance for intervention design.,Clift S.; Anemona A.; Watson-Jones D.; Kanga Z.; Ndeki L.; Changalucha J.; Gavyole A.; Ross DA.,"To measure the prevalence of HIV and other STIs in communities neighbouring new large scale gold mines in northern Tanzania in order to inform the design of a targeted HIV/STI intervention programme. Cross sectional surveys were conducted in adults aged 16-54 years from different sectors of communities neighbouring two newly opened, large scale gold mines near Lake Victoria. Mine workers, men, women, and female food and recreational facility workers (FRFW) from the community were randomly selected for interview and HIV and STI testing. 207 male Tanzanian mine workers, 206 FRFW, 202 other male and 205 female community members were enrolled. Overall, 42% of FRFW were HIV positive, compared to 6% of male mine workers, and 16% and 18% of other community men and women respectively. HIV prevalence in FRFW was significantly associated with alcohol consumption (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 5.5), past or present syphilis (TPPA+) (aOR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 5.1) and single status (aOR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 11.9). Among FRFW, 24% had active syphilis (RPR+, TPPA+), 9% Chlamydia trachomatis, and 4% Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Overall, 50% of FRFW and 50% of community men never used condoms during sex, and 55% mineworkers, 61% male, and 20% female community members reported receiving/giving payment for sex during the previous year. There is a high prevalence of HIV and other STIs in communities around new goldmines in Tanzania, especially in FRFW. HIV and STI prevalence in the mining workforce is still relatively low, but high risk sexual behaviour is reported by all adult subgroups surveyed in this study.

However, the pace of this transition and the pattern of disease epidemiology are uneven between affluent urban and rural poor populations. To address this question for a remote rural region located in the central African rainforest region of Gabon, this study was conducted to assess reasons for health care attendance and to characterize the epidemiology of malaria and other major infectious diseases for the department of Tsamba Magotsi. Major causes for health care attendance were collected from local hospital records. Cross sectional population based surveys were performed for the assessment of local malaria epidemiology. Pregnant women attending antenatal care services were surveyed as a sentinel population for the characterization of chronic viral and parasitic infections in the community. Infectious diseases were responsible for 71% (7469) of a total of 10,580 consultations at the formal health care sector in 2010. Overall, malaria - defined by clinical syndrome - remained the most frequent cause for health care attendance. A cross sectional malaria survey in 840 asymptomatic individuals residing in Tsamba Magotsi resulted in a Plasmodium spp. infection prevalence of 37%. The infection rate in 2-10 year old asymptomatic children - a standard measure for malaria endemicity - was 46% (100 of 217) with P. falciparum as predominant species (79%). Infection with other plasmodial species (P. ovale and P. malariae) presented most commonly as coinfections (23.2%). Prevalence of HIV, HBV, and syphilis were 6.2, 7.3, and 2.5%, respectively, in cross-sectional assessments of antenatal care visits of pregnant women. Urogenital schistosomiasis and the filarial pathogens Loa loa and Mansonella perstans are highly prevalent chronic parasitic infections affecting the local population. Despite major improvements in the accessibility of Tsamba Magotsi over the past decade the epidemiological transition does not appear to have majorly changed on the spectrum of diseases in this rural Gabonese population. The high prevalence of Plasmodium infection indicates a high burden of malaria related morbidity. Infectious diseases remain one of the most important health issues and further research activities in the field of tropical medicine and infectious diseases could help improve health care for the local population.",2017,01,BMC public health,17,1,130,,10.1186/s12889-017-4045-x,28129759,#1081,Manego 2017,Exclusion reason: 8.

Cross sectional study among 621 women with complaints of vaginal discharge in three city council clinics between April and August 1997. Women were interviewed and examined for symptoms and signs of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Specimens were obtained for laboratory diagnosis of genital infections, HIV, and syphilis. The data were used to evaluate the Kenyan flow chart as well as several other generated algorithms. The mean age was 24 years and 334 (54%) were pregnant. The overall prevalence rates were: 50% candidiasis, 23% trichomoniasis, 9% bacterial vaginosis, 7% gonorrhoea, 9% chlamydia, 7% syphilis, and 22% HIV. In non-pregnant women, gonococcal and chlamydial infection was significantly associated with (1) demographic and behavioural risk markers such as being single, younger than 20 years, multiple sex partners in the previous 3 months; (2) symptom fever; and (3) signs including presence of yellow or bloody vaginal discharge, cervical mucopus, cervical erythema, and friability. Among pregnant women only young age, dysuria, and fever were significantly associated with cervical infection. However, none of these variables was either sensitive or specific enough for the diagnosis of cervical infection. Several algorithms were generated and applied to the study data. The algorithm including risk markers performed slightly better than the current Kenyan algorithm. STIs form a major problem in the Nairobi area and should be addressed accordingly. None of the tested algorithms for the treatment of vaginal discharge would constitute a marked improvement of the existing flow chart.

Unrecognized sexually transmitted infections in rural South African women: a hidden epidemic.,Wilkinson D.; Abdool Karim SS.; Harrison A.; Lurie M.; Colvin M.; Connolly C.; Sturm AW.,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are of major public health concern in developing countries, not least because they facilitate transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The present article presents estimates of the prevalence, on any given day, of STIs among women in rural South Africa and the proportion who are asymptomatic, symptomatic but not seeking care, and symptomatic and seeking care. The following data sources from Hlabisa district were used: clinical surveillance for STI syndromes treated in health facilities, microbiological studies among women attending antenatal and family planning clinics, and a community survey. Population census provided denominator data. Adequacy of drug treatment was determined through quality of care surveys. Of 55,974 women aged 15-49 years, a total of 13,943 (24.9%) were infected on any given day with at least one of Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or Treponema pallidum. Of the women investigated, 6697 (48%) were asymptomatic, 6994 (50%) were symptomatic but not seeking care, 238 (1.7%) were symptomatic and would seek care, and 14 (0.3%) were seeking care on that day. Only 9 of the 14 women (65%) were adequately treated. STIs remained untreated because either women were asymptomatic or the symptoms were not recognized and acted upon. Improved case management alone is therefore unlikely to have a major public health impact. Improving partner treatment and women's awareness of symptoms is essential, while the potential of mass STI treatment needs to be explored.",1999,,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,77,1,22-8,,,10063657,#212,Wilkinson 1999,Exclusion reason: 4.

"Prevalence of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus compared with selected sexually transmitted diseases in adolescents and young adults in rural Rakai District, Uganda.",Wawer MJ.; Eng SM.; Serwadda D.; Sewankambo NK.; Kiwanuka N.; Li C.; Gray RH.,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is transmitted by routes such as homosexual intercourse and is associated with HIV infection in industrialized countries. However, there is little information about its transmission in developing countries where Kaposi sarcoma is an endemic disease. To examine KSHV seroprevalence in young adults in a general, rural Ugandan population, and to compare this prevalence with rates of known sexually transmitted infections. The seroprevalence of KSHV was compared with the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases in 523 sexually active subjects aged 15 to 29 years who were randomly selected from a general population cohort in rural Rakai District, Uganda. Participants provided in-home interview data and specimens. Sera were tested for KSHV using immunofluorescence assay and immunoblot for lytically expressed recombinant KSHV ORF65.2. Sera were also tested for HIV type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, and syphilis. The prevalence of KSHV was significantly higher in participants 15 to 19 years compared with older persons 25 to 29 years (45.0% and 36.1%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.82). In contrast, herpes simplex virus type 2 and HIV type 1 prevalence increased with age. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus serostatus was not associated with HIV type 1, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2, or number of sexual partners. Homosexual and anal intercourse were reported by less than 1% of participants.

Control of sexually transmitted diseases for AIDS prevention in Uganda: A randomised community trial,Wawer M.J.; Sewankambo N.K.; Serwadda D.; Quinn T.C.; Paxton L.A.; Kiwanuka N.; Wabwire-Mangen F.; Li C.; Lutalo T.; Nalugoda F.; Gaydos C.A.; Moulton L.H.; Meehan M.O.; Ahmed S.; Gray R.H.,"Background. The study tested the hypothesis that community-level control of sexually transmitted disease (STD) would result in lower incidence of HIV-1 infection in comparison with control communities. Methods. This randomised, controlled, single-masked, community-based trial of intensive STD control, via home-based mass antibiotic treatment, took place in Rakai District, Uganda. Ten community clusters were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. All consenting residents aged 15-59 years were enrolled; visited in the home every 10 months; interviewed; asked to provide biological samples for assessment of HIV-1 infection and STDs; and were provided with mass treatment (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole in the intervention group, vitamins/anthelmintic drug in the control). Intention-to-treat analyses used multivariate, paired, cluster-adjusted rate ratios. Findings. The baseline prevalence of HIV-1 infection was 15.9%, 6602 HIV-1-negative individuals were enrolled in the intervention group and 6124 in the control group, 75.0% of intervention-group and 72.6% of control-group participants provided at least one follow-up sample for HIV-1 testing. At enrolment, the two treatment groups were similar in STD prevalence rates. At 20-month follow-up, the prevalences of syphilis (352/6238 [5.6%) vs 359/5284 [6.8%]; rate ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.71-0.89]) and trichomoniasis (182/1968 [9.3%] vs 261/1815 [14.4%]; rate ratio 0.59 [0.38-0.91]) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. The incidence of HIV-1 infection was 1.5 per 100 person-years in both groups (rate ratio 0.97 [0.81-1.16]). In pregnant women, the follow-up prevalences of trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia infection were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. No effect of the intervention on incidence of HIV-1 infection was observed in pregnant women or in stratified analyses. Interpretation. We observed no effect of the STD intervention on the incidence of HIV-1 infection.

Methods: 1688 women who attended for antenatal care were recruited into a prospective study of the effectiveness of syphilis screening and treatment. All women were screened and treated for syphilis and other reproductive tract infections (RTIs) during pregnancy and followed to delivery to measure the incidence of stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm live birth. Findings: At delivery, 2.7% of 1536 women experienced a stillbirth, 12% of live births were preterm and 8% were LBW. Stillbirth was independently associated with a past history of stillbirth, short maternal stature and anaemia. LBW was associated with short maternal stature, ethnicity, occupation, gravidity and maternal malaria whereas preterm birth was associated with occupation, age of sexual debut, untreated bacterial vaginosis and maternal malaria. IUGR was associated with gravidity, maternal malaria, short stature, and delivering a female infant. In the women who had been screened and treated for syphilis, in between 20 and 34% of women with each outcome was estimated to be attributable to malaria, and 63% of stillbirths were estimated as being attributable to maternal anaemia. Screening and treatment of RTIs was effective and no association was seen between treated RTIs and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: Maternal malaria and anaemia continue to be significant causes of adverse pregnancy outcome in sub-Saharan Africa.

Biological impact of recurrent sexually transmitted infections on HIV seroconversion among women in South Africa: results from frailty models.,Wand H.; Ramjee G.,"Understanding the impact of curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) on HIV transmissibility is essential for effective HIV prevention programs. Investigating the impact of longitudinally measured recurrent STIs on HIV seroconversion is the interest of the current paper. In this prospective study, data from a total of 1456 HIV-negative women who enrolled in a HIV biomedical trial were used. It was hypothesized that women who had recurrent STI diagnoses during the study share a common biological heterogeneity which cannot be quantified. To incorporate this ""unobserved"" correlation in the analysis, times to HIV seroconversion were jointly modelled with repeated STI diagnoses using Cox regression with random effects. A total of 110 HIV seroconversions were observed (incidence rate of 6.00 per 100 person-years). In a multivariable model, women who were diagnosed at least once were more likely to seroconvert compared to those who had no STI diagnosis [hazard ratio (HR): 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 2.57]; women who had recurrent STI diagnoses during the study were 2.5 times more likely to be at increased risk of HIV infection (95% CI: 1.35, 4.01) with an estimated frailty variance of 1.52, with p<0.001, indicating strong evidence that there is a significant correlation (heterogeneity) among women who had recurrent STIs. In addition to this, factors associated with incidence of STIs, namely not being married and having a new sexual partner during the study follow-up, were all significantly associated with increased risk for HIV seroconversion (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.76, 5.01 and HR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.63, 3.83 respectively). The results indicated that women who were at risk for STIs were also at risk of HIV infection. In fact, they share the similar risk factors. In addition to this, repeated STI diagnoses also increased women's susceptibility for HIV infection significantly. Decreasing STIs by increasing uptake of testing and treatment and reducing partner change plays a significant role in the trajectory of the epidemic.",2015,,Journal of the International AIDS Society,18,,19866,,10.7448/IAS.18.1.19866,25912181,#1453,Wand 2015,Exclusion reason: 3.

However, most women with STIs are known to be entirely asymptomatic or if symptoms exist are often unrecognised either clinically or bacteriologically. We determine the true prevalence and aetiology of STIs among these women in Ghana. Methods This cross sectional study conducted between February and April 2014 employed a sensitive multiplex real time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that simultaneously detects seven STI bacteria pathogens in 200 women attending a Specialist STI clinic at Suntreso Government Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. Data was captured and analysed using Stata version 12. Results A total 156 (78.00%) of the women were asymptomatic. Overall, 175 (87.5%) of the women tested positive for at least one bacteria STI pathogen of which 50 (25.0%) had single infections, 76 (38.0%) and 39 (19.5%) had double and triple infections respectively. Mycoplasma hominis was the most commonly detectable pathogen present in 135 (67.5%) women. Altogether, 135 (86.54%) and 40 (90.91%) of the symptomatic and asymptomatic women tested positive for at least one pathogen (p < 0.05). There were no significant associations (p < 0.05) between the clinical manifestations as presented by the symptomatic women and the pathogens detected in their samples.

The generational effect on age disparate partnerships and the risk for human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted infections acquisition.,Street RA.; Reddy T.; Ramjee G.,"In South Africa, a large proportion of young women are in age disparate relationships, which is believed to be a risk factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The aim of this study was to determine the generational effect of age disparity on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence. Socio-demographic and behavioural data were collected from women, aged 16 and older, who were followed for up to 24 months. Women who reported having a steady sexual partner older than themselves were categorised into: (1) non-age disparate partnerships (age difference between partners was 0-4 years); (2) intra-generational age disparate partnerships (5-9 year age gap between sexual partners); and (3) inter-generational age disparate partnerships (age gap of 10 years or more between sexual partners). Of the 1355 women included in the analysis, 759, 429 and 167 were in non-age disparate, intra-generational age disparate and inter-generational age disparate partnerships, respectively. Strong predictors of inter-generational age disparate partnerships include age, marital status and concurrency of sexual partners. No significant relationship between age disparity and risk of HIV acquisition was found. The highest crude STI incidence was observed among those in intra-generational age disparate relationships followed by those in non-age disparate relationships (31.86 [26.41-38.44] and 25.60 [21.92-29.91] per 100 person-years, respectively).

STI signs and symptoms were collected using staff-administered computer-assisted personal interview and audio computer-assisted self-interview. Participants underwent a medical examination and laboratory testing for common STIs. The performance of syndromic management was assessed on the agreement between interviewing methods as well as accurate diagnosis. We screened 846 participants, of whom 88 (10.4%) received syndromic STI diagnosis while 272 (32.2%) received an aetiological diagnosis. Agreement between syndromic and aetiological diagnoses was very poor (overall kappa = 0.09).

Injectable contraception and acquisition of chlamydia and gonorrhea among south african women participating in MTN-003 (voice),Noguchi L.; Marrazzo J.; Richardson B.; Hillier S.; Balkus J.; Ramjee G.; Palanee T.; Nair G.; Selepe P.; Panchia R.; Piper J.; Gomez K.; Chirenje Z.M.,"Background: The potential impact of injectable hormonal contraception (HC) on C. trachomatis (CT) and N. gonorrhoeae (NG) acquisition in women is unclear. This is the first direct comparison of two commonly used methods of injectable HC in South Africa (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA] and norethisterone enanthate [NET-EN]) on acquisition of these infections. Methods: MTN-003 was a randomized trial of HIV chemoprevention in Africa. Women using protocol-defined effective contraception were eligible for enrollment. Testing and treatment for CT and NG occurred at baseline, annual and exit visits, and when clinically indicated. Andersen-Gill proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between injectable contraceptive type and incident CT and NG among 4,077 South African MTN-003 participants. Results: Among the 3,246 (79.6%) participants who used injectable HC during follow-up, DMPA users were more likely, compared to NET-EN users, to be >25 years (43.1% vs. 34.0%, p<0.001), but had similar baseline prevalence of CT (14.3% vs. 14.2%, p=0.95) and NG (3.2% vs. 3.7%, p=0.49). During 3,761 person-years of follow-up, 514 cases of CT (14.2/100 person-years) and 118 of NG (3.1/100 person-years) were observed. Incidence did not differ between current DMPA and NET-EN users for CT (14.1/100 personyears [p-y] vs. 14.5/100 p-y, hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.79-1.16) or NG, (3.3/100 p-y vs. 3.8/100 p-y, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58-1.09).

Conclusions: The risk of incident CT or NG did not differ between DMPA and NET-EN users. Lack of a non-HC comparator prevented estimating risk associated with either injectable method compared to non-use. Women choosing injectable HC should be counseled that risk of these infections does not differ between DMPA and NET-EN use.",2014,,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,41,"(Chirenje Z.M.)

Methods: In 11 health centres in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinee, and Mali 726 women who presented with a vaginal discharge without abdominal pain and who denied being a sex worker ( SW) were enrolled. Cervical samples were tested for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. All participants were treated with single dose (2 g) metronidazole and clotrimazole cream for 3 days. They were randomised to be told either to come back on day 7 only if there was no improvement in the discharge (group A), or to come back on day 7 regardless of response to treatment (group B). Results: Overall, the prevalence of NG and CT was only 1.9% (14/726) and 3.2% (23/726) respectively. Risk factors previously recommended by the WHO were not associated with the presence of cervical infection, with the exception of the number of sex partners in the past 3 months. When taken together, these risk factors had a positive predictive value of only 6.4% to identify cervical infections. Prevalence of cervical infection was not higher in women who came back on day 7, regardless of the strategy used. Prevalence of NG/CT was lower in Ghana and Benin (5/280, 1.8%), where comprehensive interventions for SW have been ongoing for years, than in the three other countries (27/446, 6.1%, p = 0.01).

Chlamydia Trachomatis and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae prevalence among women of reproductive age living in urogenital schistosomiasis endemic area in Ghana.,Yirenya-Tawiah D.; Annang TN.; Apea-Kubi KA.; Lomo G.; Mensah D.; Akyeh L.; Bosompem KM.,"Many studies have shown an overlap in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and urogenital schistosomiasis among young women living in schistosomiasis endemic areas. Yet we found no study assessing the prevalence of STI infections in urogenital schistosomiasis endemic areas in Ghana. As part of an epidemiological study on urogenital schistosomiasis and HIV, we sought to assess the prevalence of both Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorhoeae (NG) infections among women living in schistosomiasis endemic communities and explore the relationship between the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and self-reported symptoms. This was a cross-sectional study in which endocervical samples were collected from 191 women aged 15-49 years from October 2005 to March 2006. Samples were examined for CT and NG using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). A structured questionnaire was also used to elicit information on study participant's gynaecological and obstetric history and symptoms for genital infection. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression were used to assess association between CT and NG and other variables such as age, sexual behaviour and self-reported symptoms. The overall prevalence of CT and NG were 6.3% and 2.6% respectively.The highest prevalence rates of CT were in the 15 to 19 year group while only individuals between 15 and 39 years were positive for NG. There was no association between CT and age, contraceptive use and the other variables assessed. NG on the other hand was found to be associated with age, number of births and number of sexual partners only by chi-square test. Our research revealed higher prevalence of CT and NG infections when compared to previous studies conducted among higher risk groups in non-urogenital schistosomiasis areas in Ghana.

Data were obtained from a multicentre study of factors that determine the differences in rate of spread of HIV in four African cities. Consenting participants were interviewed on sexual behaviour, and also provided blood and urine samples for testing for HIV infection and other STDs. Data on sexual behaviour included information on condom use during all reported spousal and non-spousal partnerships in the past 12 months. A total of 2116 adults aged 15-49 years were interviewed in Cotonou (Benin), 2089 in Yaoundé (Cameroon), 1889 in Kisumu (Kenya) and 1730 in Ndola (Zambia). Prevalence rates of HIV infection were 3.4% in Cotonou, 5.9% in Yaoundé, 25.9% in Kisumu and 28.4% in Ndola. Reported condom use was low, with the proportions of men and women who reported frequent condom use with all non-spousal partners being 21-25%, for men and 11-24% for women. A higher level of condom use by city was not associated with lower aggregate level of HIV infection. The proportions of men reporting genital pain or discharge during the past 12 months were significantly lower among those reporting frequent condom use in all sites except Yaoundé: in Cotonou, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.09-0.94; in Kisumu, adjusted OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.14-0.83; and in Ndola, adjusted OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12-0.90.

There were few statistically significant associations between condom use and biological indicators of HIV infection or other STDs in any of the cities. Similar levels of condom use were found in all four populations, and aggregate levels of condom use by city could not discriminate between cities with high and low level of HIV infection.

Pregnancy Outcomes in Association with STDs including genital HSV-2 shedding in a South African Cohort Study.,Moodley D.; Sartorius B.; Madurai S.; Chetty V.; Maman S.,"Genital herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) shedding in pregnant women in association with neonatal herpes infection has been widely studied but there is limited evidence of its association with pregnancy outcomes. In this retrospective observational study, we included a subgroup of pregnant women who were enrolled in a randomized control behavioural intervention study that was conducted in South Africa in 2008-2010. In pregnancy, women had a HIV rapid test done and a genital swab taken to test for curable STIs and HSV-2 DNA. Subsequent visits were scheduled for 6, 10, 14 weeks and 9 months post-delivery. Pregnancy outcomes were documented at the 6-week or 10-week postpartum visit. Women were treated syndromically for curable STIs. Among 615 women included in this data analysis, 36.6% (n=225) tested HIV positive and 8.3% (n=51) tested positive for genital HSV-2 shedding during pregnancy. Women <24 years and HIV-1 seropositive women were 1.5 and 2.5 times more likely to test positive for HSV-2 genital shedding respectively. STI treatment records were available for 158/205 (77.1%) women; all 87 women with symptomatic STIs were treated the same day, and 50/71 (70.4%) asymptomatic women received treatment at the subsequent visit. Remaining 21 (29.6%) asymptomatic women did not receive treatment because they failed to return for antenatal follow-up. In a multivariable regression analysis, genital HSV-2 shedding, HIV-1, Neisseria gonorrhoea, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomanas vaginalis were not associated with preterm deliveries, still births and low birth weight. However with stratification by treatment for a STI, asymptomatic women who were not treated were 3.3 times more likely to deliver prematurely (33.3%; n=6/18) when compared to women who were treated during pregnancy (13.2%; n=15/114) (p=0.042).

Development and persistence of anti-chlamydial antibodies in women with incident chlamydia trachomatis infections in Uganda and Zimbabwe,Gorwitz R.; Sereday K.; Van Der Pol B.; Kwok C.; Morrison C.; Papp J.; Xu F.; Markowitz L.,"Background: Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) IgG antibodies could provide evidence of past chlamydial infection for epidemiologic studies. Antibodies to chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60) have been associated with complicated infection and infertility. Few studies have prospectively evaluated antibody development and persistence. Methods: Chlamydia serology (Medac IgG MOMP and cHSP60) was performed on stored sera from a cohort of 18-35 yr-old women seeking reproductive health services in Uganda and Zimbabwe who participated in a prospective study of HIV infection; study visits (including Ct-PCR testing) occurred on average every 80 days for up to 28 months. We analysed data on 135 women with ≥ 1 incident Ct infections who were IgG-seronegative prior to and had at least one IgG test on or after the date the incident infection was detected (“day zero”). Results: Sixty-six (49%) women seroconverted; of 54 tested on day zero, 46 (85%) were positive and 8 (15%) were negative and then positive when next tested (median 90 days). Of 12 seroconverters not tested on day zero, 11 (92%) were seropositive when next tested (median, 157 days). Nineteen (28%) of 69 non-seroconverters had no IgG testing beyond day zero and could not be assessed for delayed seroconversion. Of 52 seroconverters with subsequent testing, 27 (52%) remained persistently IgG-positive through the last test (median 248 days after seroconversion). Persistent IgG-positivity occurred in 61% (22/36) of those who were ever cHSP60-positive and 37% (6/16) of those who were not (NS), and in 56% (19/34) of those with only one Ct-PCR-positive visit and 50% (9/18) of those with more than one Ct-PCR-positive visit (NS). Conclusions Anti-MOMP IgG antibodies developed in half of women with incident Ct infection and persisted in half of them.

Characteristics of Sexually Transmitted Infections among High-Risk HIV-Positive Patients Attending an Urban Clinic in Uganda.,Katusiime C.; Schlech WF.; Parkes-Ratanshi R.; Sempa J.; Kambugu A.,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) significantly increase HIV transmission. Sexually transmitted infections may be asymptomatic and therefore remain undiagnosed in HIV-positive persons. Routine screening and treatment of STIs in HIV-positive high-risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa have not been described previously. We reviewed data from an HIV-positive high-risk population at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University, a large urban HIV clinic, between July 2011 and April 2012. Our high-risk population cohort included female sex workers, long-distance drivers, barmaids, taxi drivers, commercial motorcycle ""boda-boda"" riders, soldiers, police officers, prison officers, security guards, prisoners, and fishermen. Of 355 participants enrolled in the high-risk population's program, 21.4% were diagnosed with an STI either clinically or microbiologically. The STIs diagnosed in this population were syphilis, hepatitis B, genital herpes, human papilloma virus infection (condylomata acuminata), nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), and gonorrhea. Rates of syphilis, hepatitis B, genital herpes, condylomata acuminata, NGU, and gonorrhea were 8.5%, 7.0%, 5.4%, 1.4%, 1.4%, and 0.3%, respectively. Clinical and microbiologically diagnosed STIs were diagnosed in nearly one-fourth of the HIV-positive high-risk population. HIV care programs should note our high rates of STIs among HIV-positive high-risk populations and consider routine screening and treatment algorithms for these populations in their own settings.",,,Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care,15,1,36-41,,10.1177/2325957413506493,24144639,#1873,,Exclusion reason: 5.

The changing relationship between bacterial STIs and HIV prevalence in South Africa - an ecological study.,Kenyon CR.; Osbak K.; Buyze J.; Chico RM.,"Prevalence estimates of various bacterial sexually transmitted infections in South Africa have declined considerably since the mid-1990s. Syphilis among pregnant women, for example, declined from 10.8% in 1998 to 2.8% in 2001. We used Pearson's correlation coefficients to estimate the association between the prevalence of syphilis/male urethral discharge/male genital ulcers and the peak HIV prevalence at a district and provincial level in the early and late phases of the HIV epidemic in South Africa. Prevalence estimates of syphilis, male urethral discharge and male genital ulcers during the period preceding the peak HIV prevalence were all positively correlated with the peak HIV prevalence at a provincial level (Pearson's correlation coefficient [r] = 0.83, p = 0.006; r = 0.66, p = 0.052; r = 0.79, 0.011, respectively). These relationships all switched to a negative association later in the HIV epidemic at a provincial level (r = -0.53, p = 0.14; r = -0.73, p = 0.130; r = -0.54, p = 0.027, respectively). AIDS mortality may have played an important role in the decline of bacterial sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis in this region.

A midwife interviewed, examined, and took vaginal samples for gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Four questions were embedded in both the social workers interviews and among midwife's questions. The women were asked if they perceived their latest /current partner to be faithful, if he had complained about any genital symptoms, if a condom was used at latest sexual intercourse and if the woman knew her HIV status. The prevalence of gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia was 7.1% but for women who reported that their partner had complained about genital symptoms it was significantly higher. Agreement between answers given in the research interview and to the midwife was good for HIV status but only fair or moderate for perceived faithfulness, partner's symptoms and recent condom use. Information about risk factors revealed in individual interviews and by the midwives taking a history was incongruent.

This was a nested longitudinal analysis using data from a study of peripartum HIV acquisition in Kenya. In the parent study, HIV-uninfected women were enrolled during pregnancy and followed until 9 months postpartum. For this analysis, women who tested positive for HIV at any point, had a non-singleton pregnancy or a spontaneous abortion <20 weeks were excluded. At enrolment, laboratory methods were used to screen for bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal yeast, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). Syphilis was diagnosed using rapid plasma reagin testing and genital ulcer disease (GUD) identified by clinical examination. Treatment of laboratory-confirmed STIs and syndromic management was provided per Kenyan national guidelines. Predictors of stillbirth and infant mortality were determined using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. Overall, among 1221 women, 55% had STIs or genital infections detected: vaginal yeast (25%), BV (22%), TV (6%), CT (5%), NG (2%) and syphilis (1%). Among women with STIs/genital infections (n=592), 34% had symptoms. Overall, 19/1221 (2%) women experienced stillbirths.

In this cross-sectional study, we wanted to explore the association between STIs (including HIV) and cervical ectopy. We included 700 sexually active young women attending randomly selected high schools in a rural district in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The district is endemic of HIV and has a high prevalence of STIs. We did computer-assisted measurements of the ectocervical area covered by columnar epithelium (ectopy) in colposcopic images and STI analyses on cervicovaginal lavage and serum samples. All participating women answered a questionnaire about sexual behaviour and use of contraceptives. The mean age was 19.1 years. Ectopy was found in 27.2%, HIV in 27.8%, chlamydia in 25.3% and gonorrhoea in 15.6%. We found that age, parity, chlamydia and gonorrhoea, years since menarche, years since sexual debut and number of sexual partners were associated with ectopy. In multivariate analysis with chlamydia infection as the dependent variable, women with ectopy had increased odds of having chlamydia infection (adjusted OR 1.78, p=0.033).

After informed consent was obtained, all clients with acute STDs were offered voluntary HIV counseling and testing by 2 rapid antibody tests. Samples from rapid test-negative or -discordant subjects were pooled (50 : 5 : 1) and tested for HIV RNA. Western blots were performed on all rapid test-discordant specimens with detectable HIV RNA. A subset of specimens received p24 antigen testing with standard and/or ultrasensitive methods. Patients with possible acute HIV infection were followed to confirm seroconversion. A total of 1450 clients (34% female and 66% male) agreed to testing, of whom 588 (40.55%) had established HIV infection and 21 (1.45%) had acute infection. Discordant rapid antibody tests identified 7 of 21 (33.3% sensitivity), standard p24 antigen identified 12 of 16 (75% sensitivity), and ultrasensitive p24 antigen identified 15 of 17 (88% sensitivity) acute cases. By definition, the sensitivity of the RNA assay was 100%. Real-time pooled RNA testing for the detection of acute HIV infection is feasible in resource-limited settings.

Impact of the adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health strategy on service utilisation and health outcomes in Zimbabwe.,Muchabaiwa L.; Mbonigaba J.,"Poor reproductive health among youth and adolescents threatens their future health and economic wellbeing in Zimbabwe amidst a high HIV/AIDS prevalence. This study evaluates the impact of a multi-pronged adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) strategy implemented by government of Zimbabwe between 2010 and 2015 to improve ASRH in terms of the uptake of condoms and HIV testing as well as outcomes in terms of sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence and HIV prevalence. We combine the difference in difference and propensity score matching methods to analyse repeated Zimbabwe demographic health survey cross-sectional datasets. Young people aged 15-19 years at baseline in 2010, who were exposed for the entire five-year strategy are designated as the treatment group and young adults aged 25-29 at baseline as the control. We find that the ASRH strategy increased HIV testing amongst youth by 36.6 percent, whilst treatment of STIs also increased by 30.4 percent. We also find that the HIV prevalence trajectory was reduced by 0.7 percent. We do not find evidence of impact on condom use and STI prevalence. The findings also suggest that although HIV testing increased for all socio-economic groups that were investigated, the effect was not the same. Lastly, we do not find evidence supporting that more resources translate to better ASRH outcomes. We recommend designing future ASRH strategies in a way that differentiates service delivery for youths in HIV hotspots, rural areas and out of school. We also recommend improving the strategy's coordination and monitoring, as well as aligning and enforcing government policies that promote sexual and reproductive health rights.",2019,,PloS one,14,6,e0218588,,10.1371/journal.pone.0218588,31237891,#634,Muchabaiwa 2019,Exclusion reason: 7.

Design: 3-arm single-site open cluster randomised controlled pilot study. Setting: 30 primary schools in rural western Kenya, within a Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Participants: Primary schoolgirls 14-16 years, experienced 3 menses, no precluding disability, and resident in the study area. Interventions: 1 insertable menstrual cup, or monthly sanitary pads, against 'usual practice' control. All participants received puberty education preintervention, and hand wash soap during intervention. Schools received hand wash soap. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary: school attrition (drop-out, absence); secondary: sexually transmitted infection (STI) (Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea), reproductive tract infection (RTI) (bacterial vaginosis, Candida albicans); safety: toxic shock syndrome, vaginal Staphylococcus aureus. Results: Of 751 girls enrolled 644 were followed-up for a median of 10.9 months. Cups or pads did not reduce school dropout risk (control=8.0%, cups=11.2%, pads=10.2%). Self-reported absence was rarely reported and not assessable. Prevalence of STIs in the end-of-study survey among controls was 7.7% versus 4.2% in the cups arm (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 0.48, 0.24 to 0.96, p=0.039), 4.5% with pads (aPR=0.62; 0.37 to 1.03, p=0.063), and 4.3% with cups and pads pooled (aPR=0.54, 0.34 to 0.87, p=0.012). RTI prevalence was 21.5%, 28.5% and 26.9% among cup, pad and control arms, 71% of which were bacterial vaginosis, with a prevalence of 14.6%, 19.8% and 20.5%, per arm, respectively. Bacterial vaginosis was less prevalent in the cups (12.9%) compared with pads (20.3%, aPR=0.65, 0.44 to 0.97, p=0.034) and control (19.2%, aPR=0.67, 0.43 to 1.04, p=0.075) arm girls enrolled for 9 months or longer. No adverse events were identified.

Geographical-level contributions of risk factors for HIV infections using generalized additive models: results from a cohort of South African women.,Wand H.; Dassaye R.; Reddy T.; Yssel J.; Ramjee G.,"South Africa has the highest burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in the world with significant geographical variations. We identified the predictors of HIV infections and their sub-geographical-level contributions to the epidemic using a decade long data (2002-2012) from 6484 South African women. Generalized additive models were used to uncover the most significant features of these estimates across the region. In the overall analysis, younger age, not married or cohabiting with a partner, partner has another partner(s) and null/prim parity, using injectable contraceptives and presence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were identified as independent predictors of HIV seroconversions. Overall, the top three highest contributors to infections were women's marital status (PAR% = 73%, 95% CI: 68%, 77%), parity (PAR% = 47%, 95% CI: 42%, 53%) and partnership factors (PAR% = 37%, 95% CI: 30%, 44%). However, their contributions varied remarkably at sub-geographical level. This was mainly due to the substantial localized variations in their prevalence and hazard ratios across the region.

Data came from the Methods for Improving Reproductive Health in Africa (MIRA) study conducted in South Africa and Zimbabwe 2003-2006. Women aged 18-50 years with at least one follow-up visit within 6 months of enrollment were included. Follow-up visits included laboratory testing for pregnancy, chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and HIV, as well as self-report of hormonal contraceptive (HC) use, sexual behaviors and intravaginal practices. All visits were classified according to pregnancy status. Incidence of each STI was calculated using follow-up time.

Use of injectable progestin contraception and risk of STI among South African women.,Pettifor A.; Delany S.; Kleinschmidt I.; Miller WC.; Atashili J.; Rees H.,"This study was conducted to determine the association between the use of injectable progestin contraception (IPC) and the risk of infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) among women in South Africa. From August 1999 through May 2001, 643 HIV-1-negative women were recruited from family planning clinics in Orange Farm, South Africa. IPC [norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)] users and nonhormonal contraception users were recruited in approximately equal numbers. Eligible participants were seen at enrolment and on four follow-up visits over a 12-month period; 567 returned for at least one follow-up visit. Multivariable Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to compute the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for infections with GC, CT, BV and TV by use of NET-EN or DMPA relative to nonuse during follow-up. In multivariable models, the use of DMPA slightly increased the risk of infection with CT [IRR=1.24; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=0.80-1.94] and GC (IRR=1.30; 95% CI=0.58-2.98), although these associations were not statistically significant. In contrast, DMPA appeared to be protective for TV (IRR=0.35; 95% CI=0.12-1.01), although this estimate was very imprecise. The use of both DMPA and NET-EN was associated with a decreased risk of BV. The use of DMPA among women in this study population was associated with an increased - but not statistically significant - risk of cervical infection with chlamydia and gonorrhea, and a decreased risk of TV and BV. Given the inconsistencies and limitations of the data describing an increased risk of CT and GC with IPC use, the potential risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) must be balanced against the risk of unintended pregnancy and its health consequences, especially in developing countries.

Methods: We randomized 5045 sexually-active women at three sites in Southern Africa. Participants who tested positive for curable STIs were treated prior to enrollment as per local guidelines. Women were followed quarterly and tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infection by nucleic-acid amplification testing (Roche Amplicor®) using first-catch urine specimens.

High prevalence of HIV infection among patients with STI syndromes in Zimbabwe: Implications for prevention,Mungati M.; Machiha A.; Tshimanga M.; Gonese E.; Nyakura J.; Kilmarx P.; Shambira G.; Kupara V.; Herman-Roloff A.; Nichol A.; Handsfield H.; Rietmeijer C.,"Introduction The occurrence of sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndromes among persons with HIV infection indicates the presence of high-risk behaviours and biological co-factors favouring HIV transmission. We determined HIV prevalence among patients enrolled in a study of the aetiology of STI syndromes in Zimbabwe. Methods In an ongoing study, we enrolled men and women with genital discharge syndrome (GDS) or genital ulcer disease (GUD) at 6 geographically diverse clinics in Zimbabwe. We used Xpert® CT/NG to determine the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in urethral or vaginal specimens from all study participants. Blood samples were collected for HIV testing by a standard rapid HIV test algorithm (First Response™ followed by Alere HIV 1/2™) and considered positive when reactive on both. Blood samples were also tested for treponemal antibodies (SD Bioline HIV/syphilis DUO™). Results To date we completed laboratory test on 371 patients. Of these, 150 (40.4%) were HIV-infected. HIV rates were as follows. Female GUD: 35/62 (56.5%) vs. female GDS: 46/116 (39.7%, p = 0.05) and male GUD: 32/72 (44.4%) vs. male GDS (37/121 (30.6%, p < 0.05). HIV-infected GDS/GUD patients were significantly more likely to have positive treponemal tests compared to HIV uninfected (10.3% vs. 4.8%; p < 0.05). They were also more likely to test positive for NG (40.0% vs. 29.4%; p = 0.07), but less likely to test positive for CT (12.2% vs. 20.3%; p = 0.07). Conclusion In our study, HIV prevalence was high among patients with STI syndromes and higher among patients with GUD than patients with GDS. The high prevalence of NG infections and evidence for recent syphilis infection among persons with documented HIV infection indicates high risk behaviours related to HIV acquisition and/or ongoing HIV transmission.

Primary HIV prevention in pregnant and lactating Ugandan women: A randomized trial.,Homsy J.; King R.; Bannink F.; Namukwaya Z.; Vittinghof E.; Amone A.; Ojok F.; Rukundo G.; Amama S.; Etima J.; Matovu J.; Weissglas F.; Ojom L.; Atim P.; Darbes L.; Byamugisha J.; Rutherford G.; Katabira E.; Fowler MG.;  .,"The 'Primary HIV Prevention among Pregnant and Lactating Ugandan Women' (PRIMAL) study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an enhanced HIV counseling intervention for preventing HIV acquisition among HIV-uninfected mothers during pregnancy and throughout the breastfeeding period. We conducted an unblinded randomized control trial between 22 February 2013 and 22 April 2016 to assess the effectiveness of an extended repeat HIV testing and enhanced counseling (ERHTEC) intervention aimed at preventing primary HIV infection among HIV-uninfected pregnant and lactating women in Uganda. HIV-uninfected pregnant women aged 15-49 were enrolled 1:1 individually or in couples together with their partner. Enrolled women and couples were randomized 1:1 to an intervention (ERHTEC) or control (extended repeat HIV testing and standard counseling) group and followed up to 24 months postpartum or six weeks past complete cessation of breastfeeding, whichever came first. Both groups were tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV at enrollment, delivery, 3 and 6 months postpartum and every 6 months thereafter until the end of follow-up. The intervention group received enhanced HIV prevention counseling every 3 months throughout follow-up. The control group received standard counseling at the time of HIV retesting. Both intervention and control couples were offered couple HIV testing and counseling at all study visits. Frequency of condom use and incidence of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis over follow-up. Between February 2013 and April 2014, we enrolled 820 HIV-uninfected pregnant women presenting for antenatal care individually (n = 410) or in couples (n = 410 women and 410 partners) in one urban and one rural public Ugandan hospital. Women's median age was 24 years (IQR 20-28 years). At baseline, participants did not differ in any socio-demographic, reproductive health, HIV testing history, sexual behavior, medical history or STI status characteristics; 96% (386/402) of couples were tested and counseled for HIV together with their partners at enrolment, 2.1% (7/329) of whom were found to be HIV-infected. Six hundred twenty-five (76%) women completed follow-up as per protocol (S1 Protocol). Women were followed for an average of 1.76 years and cumulated 1,439 women-years of follow-up or 81% of the maximum 1,779 women-years of follow-up assuming no dropouts. Men were followed for an average of 1.72 years. The frequency of consistent condom use and the proportion of women who used condoms over the last 3 months or at last vaginal sex increased substantially over follow-up in both arms, but there were no statistically significant differences in increases between the intervention and control arms. During follow-up, on average 42% (range 36%-46%) of couple partners were counseled together. Between 3.8% and 7.6% of women tested positive at any follow-up visit for any STI including syphilis, gonorrhea, C. trachomatis or T. vaginalis. Four women (two in each arm) and no enrolled men became infected with HIV, representing an overall HIV incidence rate of 0.186 per 100 person-years. Three of the women seroconverters had enrolled individually, one as a couple. At or before seroconversion, all four women reported their partners had extramarital relationships and/or had not disclosed their suspected HIV-infected status. There were no statistically significant differences between study arms for STI or HIV incidences. A sustained enhanced HIV prevention counseling intervention for up to 2 years postpartum among pregnant and breastfeeding women did not have a statistically significant effect on condom use or HIV incidence among these women. However, in both study arms, condom use increased over follow-up while STI and HIV incidence remained very low when compared to similar cohorts in and outside Uganda, suggesting that repeat HIV testing during breastfeeding, whether with enhanced or standard counseling, may have had an unintended HIV preventive effect among pregnant and lactating women in this setting.

Thus, female-initiated HIV prevention methods are urgently needed. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of cellulose sulfate, an HIV-entry inhibitor formulated as a vaginal gel, involving women at high risk for HIV infection at three African and two Indian sites. The primary end point was newly acquired infection with HIV type 1 or 2. The secondary end point was newly acquired gonococcal or chlamydial infection. The primary analysis was based on a log-rank test of no difference in the distribution of time to HIV infection, stratified according to site. A total of 1398 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive cellulose sulfate gel (706 participants) or placebo (692 participants) and had follow-up HIV test data. There were 41 newly acquired HIV infections, 25 in the cellulose sulfate group and 16 in the placebo group, with an estimated hazard ratio of infection for the cellulose sulfate group of 1.61 (P=0.13). This result, which is not significant, is in contrast to the interim finding that led to the trial being stopped prematurely (hazard ratio, 2.02 [corrected]; P=0.05 [corrected]) and the suggestive result of a preplanned secondary (adherence-based) analysis (hazard ratio, 2.02; P=0.05). No significant effect of cellulose sulfate as compared with placebo was found on the risk of gonorrheal infection (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.62) or chlamydial infection (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.08).

The aetiology of genital discharge syndromes in Zimbabwe,Machiha A.; Mugurungi O.; Tshimanga M.; Kilmarx P.; Mungati M.; Nyakura J.; Shambira G.; Gonese E.; Herman-Roloff A.; Kupara V.; Lewis D.; Handsfield H.; Rietmeijer C.,"Background In many countries, sexually transmitted infections (STI) are treated syndromically. Thus, male and female patients with genital discharge syndromes (GDS) receive antimicrobials covering Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria Gonorrhoeae (NG) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infections and bacterial vaginosis (BV) among women. However, periodic surveys into the aetiology of GDS are necessary to inform treatment guidelines. Methods For this study, we enrolled 400 patients with GDS at 6 regionally diverse clinics in Zimbabwe. To date, test procedures have been completed for patients enrolled at the Harare study sites (N = 137). Sites were visited sequentially by a mobile unit of 3 trained nurses to enrol patients with STI syndromes, including GDS. STI history and risk data were collected by questionnaire and uploaded to a web-based database. Urine and vaginal specimens were taken for testing with a validated multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay (M-PCR, National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg) for CT, NG, TV and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG). Smears for Gram stain and subsequent assessment using Nugent criteria for the diagnosis of BV were obtained from all women with vaginal discharge. Results M-PCR testing is complete for all GDS patients enrolled in Harare; 68 men and 69 women. Positivity rates were as follows. Men: NG = 60.3%, CT = 13.2%, TV = 4.4%, MG = 2.9%. Women: NG = 18.8%, CT = 8.7%, TV = 14.5%, MG = 7.3%. Among women, 31.9% met Nugent criteria for BV and 20.0% had yeast infection identified on Gram stain. Conclusions In this preliminary analysis, gonorrhoea was the most common cause of GDS among both men and women, but much more common among men. Chlamydia infections were substantially less common among both men and women and trichomoniasis was more common than chlamydia infections among women. Regardless of investigated microbiologic causes, many women met criteria for BV. M. genitalium infections were uncommon overall.

Seroepidemiology of Trichomonas vaginalis in rural women in Zimbabwe and patterns of association with HIV infection.,Mason PR.; Fiori PL.; Cappuccinelli P.; Rappelli P.; Gregson S.,"Serological assays using dried blood spots from 5221 women in rural areas of eastern Zimbabwe were used to assess the epidemiology of Trichomonas vaginalis infection, and its association with HIV. Antibodies to T. vaginalis and to HIV were detected by enzyme immunoassays. Behavioural and demographic data were collected by confidential questionnaires. In total, 516 (9.9%) women were seropositive for T. vaginalis and seroprevalence increased with age among younger women. Divorced, widowed and single women were more likely to be seropositive. After controlling for age, seropositivity was significantly associated with being sexually active, having multiple sex partners, having a partner who had multiple sex partners, and having a new sex partner in the past year. Seropositivity was associated with a recent history of genital discharge. Overall, 208 (40.3%) T. vaginalis-positive samples were also positive for HIV, compared with 1106 (23.5%) T. vaginalis-negative samples (age and sex adjusted OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.74-2.55, P < 0.001). There was increased risk for being HIV-positive amongst T. vaginalis-seropositive women regardless of residence, employment or education. In a logistic regression controlling for common risk factors, the association remained significant. T. vaginalis-seropositive young women with a history of genital discharge were much more likely to be HIV-positive than women who were T. vaginalis-seronegative and had no history of discharge (OR 6.08, 95 % CI 2.95-12.53).

We randomly allocated all adults living in 18 communities in rural Uganda to receive behavioural interventions alone (group A), behavioural and STI interventions (group B), or routine government health services and community development activities (group C). The primary outcome was HIV-1 incidence. Secondary outcomes were incidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) and active syphilis and prevalence of gonorrhoea, chlamydia, reported genital ulcers, reported genital discharge, and markers of behavioural change.

Opportunity for prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections in Kenyan youth: results of a population-based survey.,Hawken MP.; Melis RD.; Ngombo DT.; Mandaliya KN.; Ng'ang'a LW.; Price J.; Dallabetta G.; Temmerman M.,"Data from sentinel serosurveillance are useful to estimate HIV infection in populations but may not be representative of the general population. General population-based surveys attempt to avoid selection bias and are the most appropriate for tracking changes in exposure to risk of HIV infection over time and assessing changes in behavior following prevention campaigns. To provide baseline data for targeted sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV infection prevention interventions by studying parameters of sexual behavior and knowledge of HIV infection and STIs, measuring health-seeking behavior related to STIs, and measuring gonorrhea, Chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV-1 prevalences. Population-based survey with stratified sampling by age group from randomly selected households in a suburb of Mombasa, Kenya. A standard questionnaire was administered to 1497 consenting adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years who lived in randomly selected households. Urine and blood samples were obtained for the estimation of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, and HIV-1 infection prevalences. Sexual activity in the past 12 months was limited to one partner in all age groups for most sexually active men (68%) and women (88%). More men than women reported two or more partners in the past 12 months (23% vs. 5%, respectively). Almost one half of those persons in the 15- to 19-year-old age group (56% of boys and 48% of girls) were sexually active. Condom use was low with all sexual partners, more so for women than for men. Reported STI symptoms in the past 12 months were high for both men and women. Knowledge of STI symptoms and HIV infection was present but incomplete. Overall HIV seroprevalence was 10.8%, with significantly higher rates among women (13.7%) than among men (8.0%). HIV seroprevalence in the 15- to 19-year-old age group was 3.2%. Female gender, Protestant religion, Catholic religion, and being divorced, separated, and widowed were significantly associated with HIV seroprevalence. Prevalences of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and syphilis were 0.9%, 1.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. This study emphasizes the vulnerability of young adults, in particular young women, to HIV infection and the need for intensive interventions in this group. The low use of condoms, incomplete knowledge of HIV infection and STIs, the high number of reported STIs, and the relatively low HIV-1 seroprevalence among the 15- to 19-year-old group indicate a large need for intensive STI and HIV infection prevention programs, especially for the 15- to 19-year-old age group.",2002,Dec,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),31,5,529-35,,10.1097/00126334-200212150-00011,12473842,#1445,Hawken 2002,Exclusion reason: 6.

Cross-sectional survey, aiming to include 1000 men and 1000 women aged 15-49 years in Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia. Participants were interviewed and tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Analyses compared the marital and non-marital partnership patterns in young men and women, and estimated the likelihood of having an HIV-infected partner. Overall, 26% of individuals in Kisumu and 28% in Ndola were HIV-positive. In both sites, HIV prevalence in women was six times that in men among sexually active 1 5-19 year olds, three times that in men among 20-24 year olds, and equal to that in men among 25-49 year olds. Age at sexual debut was similar in men and women, and men had more partners than women. Women married younger than men and marriage was a risk factor for HIV, but the disparity in HIV prevalence was present in both married and unmarried individuals. Women often had older partners, and men rarely had partners much older than themselves. Nevertheless, the estimated prevalence of HIV in the partners of unmarried men aged under 20 was as high as that for unmarried women. HIV prevalence was very high even among women reporting one lifetime partner and few episodes of sexual intercourse. Behavioural factors could not fully explain the discrepancy in HIV prevalence between men and women. Despite the tendency for women to have older partners, young men were at least as likely to encounter an HIV-infected partner as young women. It is likely that the greater susceptibility of women to HIV infection is an important factor both in explaining the male-female discrepancy in HIV prevalence and in driving the epidemic.

An extensive sociodemographic and clinical survey was administered to consenting participants, with urine samples and vaginal swabs collected to deduce active schistosomiasis and STIs, respectively. In total, 17.4% of expectant mothers were infected with Schistosoma haematobium, 3.1% with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), 1.4% with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and 14.6% with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV).

Ladislaus Batthyany-Strattmann Clinic serving for about 50 000 people, incidence of STD and HIV in infections cases was assessed and correlated. HIV VCT program has been established in 2008 as VCT center next to the clinic with one VCT counselor and 1 trained nurse. All VCT/HIV program and all OPD visits for STD were recorded monthly. Syphilis and gonorrhea were evaluated as STD. Among 42711 OPD visits in last 4 years, STD was diagnosed in 1446 patients (3.39 %) and HIV in 462 patients (1.1 %). However, 10 years ago, when the clinic started its work, HIV prevalence in males was 8.6 % and in females 11.9 %. Dramatic decrease of HIV was correlated with sustained decrease of bacterial STD's (syphilis, gonorrhea). While in 2009, 505 cases of bacterial STD and 110 new cases of HIV were detected, 421 STD's were diagnosed in 2010, 176 in 2011 and 201 in 2012 and 148 in 2013 were recorded followed decrease of HIV from 110 in 2009 to 53 in 2013. Unfortunately, proportion of adults with HIV and STD was decreasing in 2009-2013, more then 3-fold, while pediatric SDT in children <5 years increased from 0 % to 1 % in 2009 , 3 % and 6% in 2010 and in 2013, respectively. Integrated HIV/STD community program led to more 3.3 - fold decrease of STD ad 2.1-fold decrease of AIDS in rural community of Eldoret after 5 years of the introduction of VCT. Moreover, increasing prevalence STD in children <5 years of age is of great concern.",2014,,American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,91,5,158,,,,#3965,Gagova 2014,Exclusion reason: 7.

Reproductive health problems in rural South African young women: risk behaviour and risk factors.,Galappaththi-Arachchige HN.; Zulu SG.; Kleppa E.; Lillebo K.; Qvigstad E.; Ndhlovu P.; Vennervald BJ.; Gundersen SG.; Kjetland EF.; Taylor M.,"South African young women continue to be vulnerable, with high prevalence of teenage pregnancy, HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and female genital schistosomiasis (FGS). This study seeks to examine the underlying factors that may be associated with these four adverse reproductive health outcomes. In a cross-sectional study of 1413 sexually active of young women, we explored these four adverse reproductive health outcomes by considering socio-demographic factors, socio-economic factors, sexual risk behaviour, substance abuse and knowledge about reproductive health by using a questionnaire. Consenting participants were asked about previous pregnancies and were tested for HIV, STIs and FGS. Multivariable regression analyses were used to explore the factors associated with these four reproductive health outcomes. 1. Early pregnancy: Among the young women, 44.4% had already been pregnant at least once. Associated factors were hormonal contraceptives, (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 17.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.73-25.29), and sexual debut < 16 years (AOR: 3.83, 95% CI: 2.68-5.47). Living with both parents (AOR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.25-0.57) and having a steady partner (AOR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.24-0.76) were identified as protective factors against pregnancy. 2. HIV: HIV prevalence was 17.1%. The odds of having HIV were higher in intergenerational (AOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.05-4.06) and intragenerational relationships (AOR: 1.51 95% CI: 1.06-2.15), compared to age-homogenous relationships. Other associated factors were: condom use (AOR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.16-2.20), number of times treated for an STI (AOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.02-1.71), and total number of partners (AOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.28). 3. STIs: Participants who had at least one STI (40.5%) were associated with total partner number (AOR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06-1.30), and testing HIV positive (AOR: 1.88, 95% CI 1.41-2.50). 4. FGS: FGS prevalence (19.7%) was associated with previous anti-schistosomal treatment (AOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.57-3.05).

"Expanding HIV and STI care to prisoners: The experience from Zomba Central Prison, Malawi",Garone D.B.; Mateyu G.; Van Oosterhout J.; Singano V.; Van Schoor V.; Chigayo M.; Ndindi H.; Kwekwesa A.; Gaven S.; Harawa K.,"Introduction: Globally, prevalence rates of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI's) and hepatitis B (HBV) in prison populations are 2 to 50 times higher than in general populations. Risks affect prisoners, prison staff, their families and the entire community. In 2013, the Malawi Prison Services established a steering committee to scale up HIV care and treatment in Malawian Prisons. We used routinely collected programme data to evaluate the HIV cascade and prevalence of syphilis and HBV in Zomba Central Prison, a high-security facility in the south of Malawi. Description: Since 2014 Dignitas International and the Malawi Prison Health Services have been implementing a comprehensive package of care and treatment for HIV-TB and STI's. Prisoners are routinely screened for HIV, TB and STI at entry and when they are released. In addition, HIV, TB, syphilis and HBV screening campaigns are conducted every six months. Lessons learned: During a June 2015 screening campaign 1052/1745 (60%) prisoners with unknown HIV status accepted to be tested for HIV, HBV and syphilis. 68/1052 (6.5%) tested HIV positive, resulting in an overall prison HIV prevalence of 35%. 52/1052 (4.9%) tested positive for syphilis and 59/1052 (5.7%) tested positive for HBV. 1.1% were co-infected with HIV/HBV. By October 2015, 482/539 (89%) HIV positive patients were on ART, 52% were initiated due WHO 3/4, 48% due to low CD4 (<350 or <500 cells/μl, depending on calendar episode). 98% were on the standardized 1st line ART regimen. All ART patients who were eligible for routine viral load (VL) monitoring according to National Guidelines received VL testing. 277/319 (86%) were virologically suppressed (<1000 copies/μl). All patients with VL≥1,000 accessed enhanced adherence counselling. Conclusions/Next steps: Malawian Prisoners attained acceptable HIV testing coverage, high ART uptake, and good adherence demonstrated by high virological suppression. Incarceration provides an opportunity to address HIV care in hard-to-reach individuals.

Potential sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical correlates were also evaluated. Three hundred thirteen samples from 230 women were available for analysis. Five VMB clusters were identified: one cluster each dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus (KRST-I) and L. iners (KRST-II), and three clusters not dominated by a single species but containing multiple (facultative) anaerobes (KRST-III/IV/V).

The syndromic management of vaginal discharge using single-dose treatments: a randomized controlled trial in West Africa.,Pépin J.; Sobela F.; Khonde N.; Agyarko-Poku T.; Diakité S.; Deslandes S.; Labbé AC.; Sylla M.; Asamoah-Adu C.; Frost E.,"To evaluate whether single-dose treatments are as effective as standard therapy in the syndromic management of vaginal discharge. A randomized controlled effectiveness trial compared single-dose tinidazole plus fluconazole (TF) with treatment for 7 days with metronidazole plus 3 days of treatment with vaginal clotrimazole (MC) among 1570 women presenting with vaginal discharge at primary health care institutions in Ghana, Guinea, Mali and Togo. Participants were randomly allocated to one of the two treatments by research nurses or physicians using precoded envelopes. Effectiveness was assessed by symptomatic response on day 14. CLINICAL IDENTIFIER ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00313131. The two treatment regimens had similar effectiveness: complete resolution was seen in 66% (TF) and 64% (MC) and partial resolution in 33% (TF) and 34% (MC) of participants (P = 0.26). Effectiveness was similar among subgroups with vulvovaginal candidiasis, Trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis or bacterial vaginosis.

Frequency and predictors of estimated HIV transmissions and bacterial STI acquisition among HIV-positive patients in HIV care across three continents,Safren S.A.; Hughes J.P.; Mimiaga M.J.; Moore A.T.; Friedman R.K.; Srithanaviboonchai K.; Limbada M.; Williamson B.D.; Elharrar V.; Cummings V.; Magidson J.F.; Gaydos C.A.; Celentano D.D.; Mayer K.H.,"Introduction: Successful global treatment as prevention (TasP) requires identifying HIV-positive individuals at high risk for transmitting HIV, and having impact via potential infections averted. This study estimated the frequency and predictors of numbers of HIV transmissions and bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition among sexually active HIV-positive individuals in care from three representative global settings. Methods: HIV-positive individuals (n = 749), including heterosexual men, heterosexual women and men who have sex with men (MSM) in HIV care, were recruited from Chiang Mai (Thailand), Rio De Janeiro (Brazil) and Lusaka (Zambia). Participants were assessed on HIV and STI sexual transmission risk variables, psychosocial characteristics and bacterial STIs at enrolment and quarterly for 12 months (covering 15 months). Estimated numbers of HIV transmissions per person were calculated using reported numbers of partners and sex acts together with estimates of HIV transmissibility, accounting for ART treatment and condom use. Results: An estimated 3.81 (standard error, (SE) = 0.63) HIV transmissions occurred for every 100 participants over the 15 months, which decreased over time. The highest rate was 19.50 (SE = 1.68) for every 100 MSM in Brazil. In a multivariable model, country×risk group interactions emerged: in Brazil, MSM had 2.85 (95% CI = 1.45, 4.25, p<0.0001) more estimated transmissions than heterosexual men and 3.37 (95% CI = 2.01, 4.74, p<0.0001) more than heterosexual women over the 15 months. For MSM and heterosexual women, the combined 12-month STI incidence rate for the sample was 22.4% (95% CI = 18.1%, 27.3%; incidence deemed negligible in heterosexual men). In the multivariable model, MSM had 12.3 times greater odds (95% CI = 4.44, 33.98) of acquiring an STI than women, but this was not significant in Brazil. Higher alcohol use on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.08) was also significantly associated with increased STI incidence. In bivariate models for both HIV transmissions and STI incidence, higher depressive symptoms were significant predictors. Conclusions: These data help to estimate the potential number of HIV infections transmitted and bacterial STIs acquired over time in patients established in care, a group typically considered at lower transmission risk, and found substantial numbers of estimated HIV transmissions. These findings provide an approach for evaluating the impact (in phase 2 studies) and potentially cost-effectiveness of global TasP efforts.",2016,,Journal of the International AIDS Society,19,1,,,10.7448/IAS.19.1.21096,,#4104,Safren 2016,Exclusion reason: 3.

Targeted Pregnancy and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Prevention Risk-Reduction Counseling for Young Women: Lessons Learned from Biomedical Prevention Trials.,Ramjee G.; Dassaye R.; Reddy T.; Wand H.,"Women enrolled in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention efficacy trials receive counseling on prevention of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and pregnancy during every visit. Incident pregnancy has an impact on efficacy outcomes. Incidence rates of pregnancy and HIV/STIs among women who became pregnant and associated risk factors were assessed. Data from 9165 women participating in HIV prevention trials in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa from 2002-2012 were combined. Demographic and behavioral predictors of incidence pregnancy and incidence HIV and STIs were determined using Cox regression models. Overall pregnancy incidence was 9.6 per 100 person-year (py) (95% confidence interval [Cl], 9.1-10.3). Human immunodeficiency virus incidence among pregnant women was 5.93 per 100 py (95% Cl, 4.73-7.44). Incidence of STIs among pregnant women for Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Treponema pallidum (syphilis) were 10.87, 7.42, 3.92, and 1.43 per 100 py, respectively. In the adjusted analyses, we observed overlapping risk factors for HIV acquisition during pregnancy, ie, young age, not married/not cohabitating, and low parity.

Previous reports have found that university students in Africa comprise a sexually active population, although the prevalence of HIV or sexually transmitted infections (STI) has not been measured. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of students from five large universities in Kampala, Uganda, using respondent-driven sampling. We asked students to complete behavioral questionnaires and provide biological samples to test for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis. We enrolled 649 students and obtained interpretable data from 640. Around 50% of the respondents were male, and the mean age was 22 years.

Turichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: inadequately managed with the syndromic approach,"Romoren, M.; Velauthapillai, M.; Rahman, M.; Sundby, J.; Klouman, E.; Hjortdahl, P.","Objective To measure the prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection and bacterial vaginosis (BV) among pregnant women in Botswana, and to evaluate the syndromic approach and alternative management strategies for these conditions in pregnancy. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 703 antenatal care attendees were interviewed and examined, and specimens were collected to identify TV, BV, Candida species, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Information on reproductive tract infections earlier in pregnancy was obtained from a structured interview and the antenatal record. Findings TV was found in 19% and BV in 38% of the attendees. Three-fourths of women with TV or BV were asymptomatic. Syndromic management according to the vaginal discharge algorithm would lead to substantial under-diagnosis and over-treatment of TV and BV. Signs of vaginal discharge were more predictive of the presence of these conditions than were symptoms. Among the 546 attendees on a repeat antenatal visit, 142 (26%) had been diagnosed with vaginal discharge earlier in their pregnancy - 14 of them twice. In 143 cases, an attendee was diagnosed with vaginal discharge in the second or third trimester; however, metronidazole had been prescribed only 17 times (12%). Conclusion Diagnosis and treatment of TV and BV among pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa presents major challenges. Half the pregnant women in this study were diagnosed with TV or BV, but these conditions were not detected and treated during antenatal care with syndromic management.

HIV-1 seroprevalence among pregnant women in rural Uganda: a longitudinal study over fifteen years.,Reuschel E.; Tibananuka S.; Seelbach-Goebel B.,"In order to determine the development of the prevalence of HIV infection in rural Western Uganda, data of epidemiological studies conducted in 2001 and 2007 were compared to study data from 1993. In 2001 (n = 466) and in 2007 (n = 486), one group each of clinically healthy pregnant women of a local prenatal care department were enrolled in the study and anonymously screened for HIV-1. For both groups, informed consent was obtained prior to enrolment. Testing for HIV was done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by Western blot. In addition, age and antibodies against syphilis were determined as risk factors of HIV infection. The seroprevalence of HIV-1 infection did not decrease significantly over this time period, dropping from 28.3 to 25.1% between 2001 and 2007, but the prevalence of syphilis antibodies decreased from 27.9 to 11.1%.

Comparing patterns of sexual risk among adolescent and young women in a mixed-method study in Tanzania: implications for adolescent participation in HIV prevention trials.,Tolley EE.; Kaaya S.; Kaale A.; Minja A.; Bangapi D.; Kalungura H.; Headley J.; Baumgartner JN.,"Despite the disproportionate impact of HIV on women, and adolescents in particular, those below age 18 years are underrepresented in HIV prevention trials due to ethical, safety and logistical concerns. This study examined and compared the sexual risk contexts of adolescent women aged 15-17 to young adult women aged 18-21 to determine whether adolescents exhibited similar risk profiles and the implications for their inclusion in future trials. We conducted a two-phase, mixed-method study to assess the opportunities and challenges of recruiting and retaining adolescents (aged 15-17) versus young women (18-21) in Tanzania. Phase I, community formative research (CFR), used serial in-depth interviews with 11 adolescent and 12 young adult women from a range of sexual risk contexts in preparation for a mock clinical trial (MCT). For Phase II, 135 HIV-negative, non-pregnant adolescents and young women were enrolled into a six-month MCT to assess and compare differences in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes, including risky sexual behaviour, incident pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), reproductive tract infections (RTIs) and HIV. In both research phases, adolescents appeared to be at similar, if not higher, risk than their young adult counterparts. Adolescents reported earlier sexual debut, and similar numbers of lifetime partners, pregnancy and STI/RTI rates, yet had lower perceived risk. Married women in the CFR appeared at particular risk but were less represented in the MCT. In addition, adolescents were less likely than their older counterparts to have accessed HIV testing, obtained gynaecological exams or used protective technologies. Adolescent women under 18 are at risk of multiple negative SRH outcomes and they underuse preventive services. Their access to new technologies such as vaginal microbicides or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may similarly be compromised unless greater effort is made to include them in clinical trial research.",2014,,Journal of the International AIDS Society,17,3 Suppl 2,19149,,10.7448/IAS.17.3.19149,25224611,#1231,Tolley 2014,Exclusion reason: 5.

"Microbiological surveillance for sexually transmitted infections in Windhoek and Oshakati, Namibia (2007)",Tobias S.; Shonhiwa S.; Norbert F.; Oke O.; Ndjavera C.; Chikukwa S.; Radebe F.; Lewis D.,"Background: A microbiological survey was undertaken to enable review of Namibia's syndromic management-based STI treatment guidelines (1999). Methods: This Government-approved survey took place at Katutura Health Centre (Windhoek) and Oshakati Intermediate Hospital over 9 months in 2007. Consecutive patients with urethral discharge (UDS), vaginal discharge (VDS) and genital ulcer (GUS) syndromes gave verbal consent to provide anonymous samples for the following tests-(i) real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) (UDS, urethral swabs; VDS, endocervical swabs) (ii) RT-PCR detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum (TP), Haemophilus ducreyi (HD), Chlamydia trachomatis L1-L3 (LGV) (ulcer swabs), (iii) Giemsa staining of ulcer smears for granuloma inguinale (GI), (iv) Gram staining of vaginal smears for Candida (CA) and bacterial vaginosis (BV), (v) NG culture and determination of ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) by E test (urethral swabs), and (vi) HIV ELISA (blood). All patients were provided with STI syndromic treatment, offered same-day HIV counselling and testing, and partner notification was discussed. Data analysis was performed in STATA v10 and the χ2 test used to assess difference by survey site. Results: 199 UDS, 200 VDS and 199 GUS episodes were surveyed among 598 patients (293, Windhoek; 305, Oshakati). The relative prevalence of pathogens/conditions by syndrome was-(i) UDS-NG 87% (173), CT 9% (18), TV 5% (9), MG 2% (4), (ii) VDS-NG 5% (9), CT 8% (15), TV 15% (29), MG 4% (8), BV 65% (127), CA 17% (33), and (iii) GUS-HSV 49% (97), TP 3% (5), LGV 2% (2), GI 0.5% (1), HD 0% (0). Syndrome-specific HIV prevalence was 36% (62) for UDS, 29% (57) for VDS and 53% (91) for GUS. Ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC=1) was detected in 28 (24%) of 118 viable NG isolates; all isolates were deemed susceptible to ceftriaxone. Ciprofloxacin resistance was significantly higher in Oshakati compared to Windhoek (48% vs 5%, p<0.001). Conclusions: The survey highlighted the importance of gonorrhoea, genital herpes, HIV-coinfection and, in Oshakati, the high prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistant NG. As a result of this survey, Namibia's STI guidelines were revised in 2008 by adding acyclovir to existing GUS treatment and replacing ciprofloxacin with oral cefixime as treatment for presumptive gonorrhoea.",2011,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,87,"(Radebe F.; Lewis D.)

The sexual health of pupils in years 4 to 6 of primary schools in rural Tanzania.,Todd J.; Changalucha J.; Ross DA.; Mosha F.; Obasi AI.; Plummer M.; Balira R.; Grosskurth H.; Mabey DC.; Hayes R.,"There is an urgent need for effective interventions to improve the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents. Reliable data on the sexual health of adolescents are needed to guide the development of such interventions. The aim was to describe the sexual health of pupils in years 4 to 6 of 121 rural primary schools in north western Tanzania, before the implementation of an innovative sexual health intervention in 58 of the schools. A cross sectional survey of primary school pupils in rural Tanzania was carried out. The study population comprised pupils registered in years 4 to 6 of 121 primary schools in 20 rural communities in 1998. Basic demographic information was collected from all pupils seen. Those born before 1 January 1985 (aged approximately 14 years and over) were invited to participate in the survey, and asked about their knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health issues, and their sexual experience. A urine specimen was requested and tested for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and, for females, pregnancy. 9283 pupils born before 1 January 1985 were enrolled and provided demographic information and a urine sample. Male pupils were significantly older than females (mean age 15.5 years v 14.8 years, p<0.001), but all other demographic characteristics were similar between the sexes. 14 (0.2%) of the enrolled pupils (four male and 10 female) were HIV positive, 83 (0.9%) were positive for CT, and 12 (0.1%) for NG. 32 female pupils (0.8%) were positive by pregnancy test. Sexual experience was reported by one fifth of primary school girls, and by almost half of boys. Only 45/114 (39%) girls with biological markers of sexual activity reported having had sex. HIV, CT, NG, and pregnancy were present though at relatively low levels among pupils in years 4 to 6 of primary school. A high proportion of pupils with a biological marker of sexual activity denied ever having had sex.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, syphilis, and anemia were assessed in a cross-sectional study of 572 pregnant women. In a nested case-control study, chorioamnionitis (CAM) was examined; tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, cortisol, and corticotropin-releasing hormone were measured in placental, maternal and/or cord blood. HIV, infrequent antenatal clinic attendance, low-maternal weight, no intermittent preventive malaria therapy (IPT), and CAM were associated with PTD, while malaria was not. Of the 18 compartmental cytokine measurements, elevations in placental and/or cord IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with both CAM and PTD. In contrast, there was no overlap between the cytokines affected by malaria and those associated with PTD. The HIV and CAM were the major infections associated with PTD in this study.

Male circumcision and HIV infection in four cities in sub-Saharan Africa,Auvert B.; Buvé A.; Lagarde E.; Kahindo M.; Chege J.; Rutenberg N.; Musonda R.; Laourou M.; Akam E.; Weiss H.A.,"Objectives: To explore the role of male circumcision in the spread of HIV infection in four urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Design and methods: A cross-sectional population based study was conducted in four cities in sub-Saharan Africa with different levels of HIV infection. HIV prevalence among adults was relatively low in Cotonou (Benin) and in Yaoundé (Cameroon), and exceeded 25% in Kisumu (Kenya) and in Ndola (Zambia). In each city, a random sample was taken of men and women aged 15-49 years from the general population. Consenting study participants were interviewed about their sociodemographic characteristics and their sexual behaviour, and were tested for HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2, syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection. Men underwent a genital examination. Results: In Cotonou and in Yaoundé, the two low HIV prevalence cities, 99% of men were circumcised. In Kisumu 27.5% of men were circumcised, and in Ndola this proportion was 9%. In Kisumu, the prevalence of HIV infection was 9.9% among circumcised men and 26.6% among uncircumcised men. After controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and other sexually transmitted infections, the protective effect of male circumcision remained with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.26 (95% confidence interval = 0.12-0.56). In Ndola, the prevalence of HIV infection was 25.0% in circumcised men and 26.0% in uncircumcised men. The power was insufficient to adjust for any differences in sexual behaviour. Conclusions: The differences in epidemic spread of HIV are likely to be due to differences in the probability of transmission of HIV during sexual exposure as well as differences in sexual behaviour. Male circumcision is one of the factors influencing the transmission of HIV during sexual intercourse, and this study confirms the population level association between HIV and lack of male circumcision, as well as a strong individual level association in Kisumu, the only city with sufficient power to analyze this association. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2001,,AIDS,15,SUPPL. 4,S31-S40,,10.1097/00002030-200108004-00004,,#2119,Auvert 2001,Exclusion reason: 4.

We aimed to calculate this probability overall, and to estimate how it is affected by various factors thought to influence infectivity. 174 monogamous couples, in which one partner was HIV-1 positive, were retrospectively identified from a population cohort in Rakai, Uganda. Frequency of intercourse and reliability of reporting within couples was assessed prospectively. HIV-1 seroconversion was determined in the uninfected partners, and HIV-1 viral load was measured in the infected partners. Adjusted rate ratios of transmission per coital act were estimated by Poisson regression. Probabilities of transmission per act were estimated by log-log binomial regression for quartiles of age and HIV-1 viral load, and for symptoms or diagnoses of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the HIV-1-infected partners. The mean frequency of intercourse was 8.9 per month, which declined with age and HIV-1 viral load. Members of couples reported similar frequencies of intercourse. The overall unadjusted probability of HIV-1 transmission per coital act was 0.0011 (95% CI 0.0008-0.0015). Transmission probabilities increased from 0.0001 per act at viral loads of less than 1700 copies/mL to 0.0023 per act at 38 500 copies/mL or more (p=0.002), and were 0.0041 with genital ulceration versus 0.0011 without (p=0.02). Transmission probabilities per act did not differ significantly by HIV-1 subtypes A and D, sex, STDs, or symptoms of discharge or dysuria in the HIV-1-positive partner.

Epidemiology of curable sexually transmitted infections among women at increased risk for HIV in northwestern Tanzania: inadequacy of syndromic management.,Francis SC.; Ao TT.; Vanobberghen FM.; Chilongani J.; Hashim R.; Andreasen A.; Watson-Jones D.; Changalucha J.; Kapiga S.; Hayes RJ.,"Curable, non-viral pathogens account for a significant burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and there is established evidence that STIs increase both HIV acquisition and transmission. We investigated the prevalence, trends, and factors associated with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis and Treponema pallidum, and the performance of syndromic management, among a cohort of women working in bars, hotels, and other food and recreational facilities near large-scale mines in northwestern Tanzania. HIV-negative women aged 18-44 years (N = 966) were enrolled and followed for 12 months in a microbicides feasibility study. We collected sociodemographic and behavioural data, performed clinical examinations, and tested for STIs, at enrolment and 3-monthly. Risk factors for STIs were investigated using logistic regression models with random effects. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of syndromic management were calculated. At enrolment, the prevalences of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, and high-titre active syphilis were 111/956 (12%), 42/955 (4%), 184/945 (19%) and 46/965 (5%), respectively. There were significant decreases over time for C. trachomatis and T. vaginalis (OR trend per month: 0.94 [95% CI 0.91, 0.97]; and 0.95 [0.93, 0.98], respectively; both p<0.001). The majority of these infections were not diagnosed by the corresponding syndrome; therefore, most participants were not treated at the diagnosis visit. Syndromic management was poorly predictive of laboratory-diagnosed infections. We identified a number of risk factors for STIs, including low educational level, some sexual behaviours, and ever having been pregnant. This analysis demonstrates that the prevalences of curable STIs are high among women who work in food and recreational facilities in northwestern Tanzania. Most of these infections are missed by syndromic management. Accurate and affordable rapid-point-of-care tests and innovative interventions are needed to reduce the burden of STIs in this population which is at increased risk for HIV.",2014,,PloS one,9,7,e101221,,10.1371/journal.pone.0101221,25025338,#1799,Francis 2014,Exclusion reason: 5.

We did a randomised trial to determine whether a text-messaging intervention improved retention during the first year of HIV care. This unmasked, randomised parallel-group study was done at two clinics in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, HIV-positive, had their own mobile phone or access to one, and were able to use simple text messaging (or have somebody who could text message on their behalf). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), with random block sizes of 2, 4, and 6, to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group received a weekly text message from the automated WelTel service for 1 year and were asked to respond within 48 h. Participants in the control group did not receive text messages. Participants in both groups received usual care, which comprised psychosocial support and counselling; patient education; CD4 cell count; treatment; screening for tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, and sexually transmitted infections; prevention of mother-to-child transmission and family planning services; and up to two telephone calls for missed appointments. The primary outcome was retention in care at 12 months (ie, clinic attendance 10-14 months after the first visit). Participants who did not attend this 12-month appointment were traced, and we considered as retained those who were confirmed to be active in care elsewhere. The data analyst and clinic staff were masked to the group assignment, whereas participants and research nurses were not. We analysed the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01630304. Between April 4, 2013, and June 4, 2015, we screened 1068 individuals, of whom 700 were recruited. 349 people were allocated to the intervention group and 351 to the control group. Participants were followed up for a median of 55 weeks (IQR 51-60). At 12 months, 277 (79%) of 349 participants in the intervention group were retained, compared with 285 (81%) of 351 participants in the control group (risk ratio 0·98, 95% CI 0·91-1·05; p=0·54). There was one mild adverse event related to the intervention, a domestic dispute that occurred when a participant's partner became suspicious of the weekly messages and follow-up calls.

High prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhoea among patients with genital ulcer disease in Zimbabwe: Potential implications for syndromic management,Mungati M.; Mugurungi O.; Machiha A.; Tshimanga M.; Kilmarx P.; Nyakura J.; Shambira G.; Gonese E.; Herman-Roloff A.; Kupara V.; Lewis D.; Handsfield H.; Rietmeijer C.,"Background Syndromic management of genital ulcer disease (GUD) as recommended by the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care, includes antibiotics against Treponema pallidum (TP: benzathine penicillin), Haemophilus ducreyi (HD: erythromycin), and herpes simplex virus (HSV: acyclovir). However, these medications are not recommended to treat co-infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG: ceftriaxone or kanamycin) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT: doxycycline or azithromycin) and, unless a person with GUD is simultaneously diagnosed with genital discharge syndromes (GDS), NG and CT co-infections will not be treated according to guidelines. Methods In an ongoing study, we enrolled men and women with GDS or GUD syndromes in 6 clinics with high STI prevalence in Zimbabwe. In addition to testing ulcer secretions for TP, HD, and HSV by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Johanneburg), all patients had urine (males) or vaginal swabs (females) tested for NG and CT by nucleic acid amplification (GeneXpert®). Results To date, 302 patients have been enrolled for whom testing is complete, including 106 GUD and 196 GDS patients. NG and/or CT infections were present in 19/52 (36.5%) female GUD patients and 13/54 (24.1%) male GUD patients, compared to 26/96 (27.1%) female GDS patients and 68/100 (68.0%) male GDS patients. Of 32 GUD patients infected with NG (N = 24) and/or CT (N = 17), including 9 dual infections, only 4/18 (22%) of women and 4/14 (29%) of men met objective criteria for simultaneous GDS syndromic management. Conclusion In our study, urethral or vaginal GC and/or CT infections were present in 30% of patients with GUD, of whom three quarters would not have been treated according to recommended syndromic treatment guidelines for sexually transmitted infections.

Performance of GeneXpert® CT/NG in the diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis among men and women with genital discharge syndrome in Zimbabwe,Mungati M.; Mugurungi O.; Machiha A.; Tshimanga M.; Kilmarx P.; Nyakura J.; Shambira G.; Gonese E.; Herman-Roloff A.; Kupara V.; Lewis D.; Handsfield H.; Rietmeijer C.,"Background In many countries, patients with genital discharge syndrome (GDS) are treated syndromically with antibiotics that cover both Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). The syndromic approach leads to both over-treatment (as most patients are not dually infected) and undertreatment (as asymptomatic infections are not detected). We studied the performance of the GeneXpert® nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) as a testing platform for NG and CT in a study of the aetiology of GDS in Zimbabwe. Materials and methods In an ongoing study, we enrolled 400 patients with GDS in 6 regionally diverse clinics in Zimbabwe serving high numbers of STI cases. Urine (men) and vaginal (women) specimens were taken for testing on 3 NAAT platforms: GeneXpert®, Probetec™ and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR), conducted in different laboratories. We analysed overall concordance of results between platforms and assessed the performance of the GeneXpert® test when compared to a gold standard comprised of concordant results on both Probetec™ and M-PCR platforms. Results To date, a total of 197 men and 200 women with GDS have been enrolled. Testing on all 3 platforms is complete for the 136 GDS patients enrolled in Harare. Concordance of positive or negative results for all 3 platforms was 133/136 (97.8%) for NG and 132/136 (97.0%) for CT. Sensitivity of the GeneXpert ® platform compared to the Probetec™/M-PCR combined gold standard was 100% for both NG and CT; specificity was 98.8% for NG and 100% for CT. Conclusions Aetiologic diagnosis has long been out of reach for many countries. However, the increasing presence of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) devices in many countries, such as GeneXpert®, for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and other infections, opens the possibility to use them for the diagnosis of other pathogens including NG and CT as an alternative or adjunct to syndromic management.",2015,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,91,"(Rietmeijer C.)

Methods: School students (n=1057), enrolled in a cluster-randomised intervention trial in the Eastern Cape, were tested for STIs at the 42 (42M) and 54 (54M) month follow-up visits. Students filled in questionnaires, provided blood for herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) serology (HerpeSelect IgG, Focus Diagnostics) and urine to test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) (Aptima Combo 2 and Aptima TV, GenProbe). Positive NG/CT/TV results were confirmed by other assays (Aptima NG, Aptima CT, Gen-Probe; T vaginalis Real-TM, Sacace Biotechnologies). Students with NG/CT/TV received treatment and partner follow-up; those with HSV-2 infection were counselled. STI prevalence was determined by gender at each visit; overall incidence was estimated using results for all students attending both visits and also for a subgroup who reported ever having had vaginal intercourse. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed and associations investigated with the χ2 test. Results: 959 (91%) and 977 (92%) students tested for STIs at 42M and 54M, respectively. The students' mean age (SD) was 15.8 (1.25) years at 42M and 16.8 (1.25) years at 54M. At 42M, 149 (15.5%) had curable STIs and 67 (7.0%) had HSV-2 infection. At 54M, 154 (15.8%) had curable STIs and 104 (10.7%) had HSV-2 infection. All (Table presented) curable STIs were treated. Females had a higher prevalence of all pathogens at both visits (p<0.001 for all, Abstract O1-S04.05 table 1). Overall annual incidence rates (per 1,000, 95% CI), based on results of the 934 (96%) students who attended the 42M/54M visits (934 urine, 931 serology tests), were substantially higher in females compared to males [males: GC 18.4 (8.7-36.6), CT 73.7 (52.4-102.5), TV 0.0 (0.0-10.6), HSV-2 28.6 (15.9-59.9); females: GC 76.0 (55.6-102.8), CT 184.0 (152.7-220.4), TV 40.0 (25.7-61.3), HSV-2 64.4 (44.9-91.3)]. Incidence rates were also calculated for students (311 females, 66%; 334 males, 77%) who reported ever having had vaginal intercourse (Abstract O1-S04.05 table 1). Compared to overall rates, females had significantly higher rates for each STI (GC/CT, p<0.001; TV, p =0.027; HSV-2, p =0.015); this was not the case for males.

"Associations of chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and women with genital discharge syndromes in Johannesburg, South Africa",Radebe F.; Ricketts C.; Kekana V.; Vezi A.; Basson I.; Magooa P.; Bhojraj-Sewpershad N.; De Gita G.; Maseko V.; Lewis D.A.,"Background: As part of an on-going STI microbiological surveillance programme, we investigated associations between Chlamydia trachomatis infection and the demographic, clinical, microbiological and behavioural characteristics of patients presenting with either male urethral discharge syndrome (MUDS) or vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) to a public healthcare facility in Johannesburg, South Africa Methods: 1,218 MUDS and 1,232 VDS cases were consecutively recruited during 6 annual surveys, starting in 2007. Genital discharge pathogens were detected using a molecular assay for N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas Vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium and by microscopy of vaginal smears (bacterial vaginosis, Candida). Serology was used to detect syphilis, HSV-2 and HIV infections. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of C. trachomatis infection. Results: Overall, 286 (23.5%) men and 197 (16.0%) women were C. trachomatis positive, with the highest prevalence observed in men (30.5%) and women (25.9%) aged 20-24 years. In the multivariate analysis, C. trachomatis was less likely to be detected in MUDS patients co-infected with N. gonorrhoeae (aOR 0.36, 95% CI, 0.26-0.49) and HSV-2 (aOR 0.70, 95% CI, 0.51-0.95) as well as patients who had received antibiotics recently (aOR 0.43. 95% CI, 0.20-0.91). In contrast, the likelihood of C. trachomatis infection was higher in VDS patients co-infected with either N. gonorrhoeae (aOR 2.22, 95% CI, 1.48-3.32) or M. genitalium (aOR 2.24, 95% CI, 1.45-3.47) infection but lower in women who were older (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60-0.77) or who had Candida morphotypes detected (aOR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.98). Conclusion: The increased likelihood of co-existent gonococcal or M. genitalium infections, but the decreased likelihood of Candida infection, in women with VDS-associated chlamydial infection suggests that these women are at higher risk of STIs, and potentially HIV. Paradoxically, gonococcal infection as well as recent antibiotic use, reduced the likelihood of MUDS patients having chlamydial infection.",2013,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,89,"(Radebe F.; Ricketts C.; Kekana V.; Vezi A.; Basson I.; Magooa P.; Bhojraj-Sewpershad N.; De Gita G.; Maseko V.; Lewis D.A.)

Prevalence of chlamydial infections within eight South African provinces (2006-2011),Radebe F.; Maseko V.; Basson I.; De Gita G.; Takuva S.; Lewis D.A.,"Background: The microbiological surveillance was undertaken in eight provinces of South Africa during 2006-2011 to determine the aetiology of the male urethritis syndrome (MUS), vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) and genital ulcer syndrome (GUS) and the prevalence of HIV, HSV-2 and syphilis. Methods: 1361 MUS, 1691 VDS and 465 GUS cases were consecutively recruited in eight South African provinces (2006-2011). Laboratory-based diagnostic methods included nucleic acid amplification to detect Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas Vaginalis, Herpes Simplex Virus 2, Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema pallidum and Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1-3. Results: Overall, 202 (14.9%) MUS and 240 (14.2%) VDS cases were positive for C. trachomatis while 6 (1.3%) GUS cases were positive for C. trachomatis serovars L1-3. The highest prevalence of C. trachomatis was 21.1% in Gauteng among men and 19.4% in women. The prevalence in other provinces was: Mpumalanga (men 18.4%; women 17.4%), Limpopo (men 14.0%; women 16.7%), Eastern Cape (men 16.4%; women 13.5%), Western Cape (men 13.5%; women 14.9%), Northwest (men 10.3%; women 11.1%), Free State (men 8.0%; women 9.8%) and Northern Cape (men 8.1%; women 9.6%). C. trachomatis serovars LI-3 prevalence was 3.2% in the Free State, 2.8% in Mpumalanga and 0.7% in Gauteng. No C. trachomatis serovars L1-3 were detected in other five provinces. Conclusions: The prevalence of C. trachomatis infection was high in this population and remains an important cause of genital infection in South Africa particularly in men.

Pooling strategy to detect acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) among at-risk women,Kilembe W.; Kampamba S.; Sichone P.; Siyumbwa N.; Mungandi N.; Sharkey T.; Visoiu A.-M.; Ko J.; Michelo C.; Tichacek A.; Inambao M.; Nyombayire J.; Allen S.; Price M.; Karita E.; Hunter E.,"Background: Identification and recruitment of people with acute HIV-1 Infection (AHI), provides a unique opportunity to study HIV pathogenesis and disease progression. Additionally, AHI cohorts are a useful resource to characterize immune responses to the transmitted founder virus, which can in turn inform vaccine design. The objective of this study was to develop a pooling strategy using the GeneXpert platform to detect AHI among at-risk individuals. Methods: In preparation for upcoming HIV vaccine trials, the Zambia Emory HIV Research Project (ZEHRP) recruited a cohort of women at-risk for HIV. From August 2017 to April 2018, we pooled samples from women who came for screening, enrollment, or scheduled cohort visits. Blood samples collected at these visits were tested for both HIV and syphilis. On a daily basis, plasma samples for women with negative HIV serology results were pooled and tested for AHI using the GeneXpert machine. Samples from a positive GeneXpert pool were deconvoluted to identify individual sample with AHI. Results: We tested 116 plasma pools, containing 732 individual samples from 575 women with a mean age of 23 years (IQR= 21-27). We detected four AHI cases in pools of eight samples, on average. By using this pooling strategy, we used 84% fewer test kits compared to testing each sample individually. Deconvolution of a positive pool was completed on the day of testing. The mean pool log10 viral load (VL) was 5.11 (range 1.68-5.82), and the mean individual sample log10 VL was 6.24 (range 3.26-6.71). Three of the four women consented to enroll in a follow-up study post AHI detection, and seroconversion occurred on days 11, 17, and 27. Conclusions: Pooling of plasma samples is a cost-efficient and timesaving strategy to detect AHI. The high VL in acute infections enables the detection of AHI when many samples are pooled. It is feasible to identify and enroll AHI patients to advance virologic and immunologic correlates of HIV transmission research.",2018,,AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses,34,"(Price M.)

Single Mothers and Female Sex Workers in Zambia Have Similar Risk Profiles.,Kilembe W.; Inambao M.; Sharkey T.; Wall KM.; Parker R.; Himukumbwa C.; Tichacek A.; Malama K.; Visoiu AM.; Price M.; Chomba E.; Allen S.,"The aim of the study was to compare reproductive health and high-risk behaviors in female sex workers (FSWs) and single mothers (SMs) in Zambia's two largest cities, Lusaka and Ndola. FSWs were invited from known community hot spots, and sexually active HIV- SMs were referred from infant vaccination services for free and anonymous screening and treatment for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and long acting reversible contraception. A subset completed an interviewer-administered survey. From 2012 to 2016, 1,893 women (1,377 FSWs and 516 HIV- SMs) responded to referrals. HIV prevalence was 50% in Lusaka and 33% in Ndola FSWs. Positive syphilis serology (rapid plasmin reagin) was found in 29%-31% of HIV+ FSWs and 9%-12% of HIV- FSWs and SMs. Trichomonas was more common in Ndola (11%-12%), compared with Lusaka (3%-7%). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) use among HIV+ FSWs was 9%-15%. In all groups, consistent condom use (8%-11%) and modern contraceptive use (35%-65%) were low. Low literacy and reported coercion at first sexual intercourse were common in both FSWs and SMs, as was alcohol use during sex among FSWs. Zambian FSWs and SMs have low condom use and high HIV/STI and unplanned pregnancy risk. Many FSWs and half of SMs are ≥25 years of age, and thus too old for HIV prevention services targeting ""adolescent girls and young women"" (aged 15-24).

In the process the study evaluated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence, prevalence, and risk profiles for HIV-acquisition among young women in urban Zambia. Women aged 16 to 49 years were screened for participation in the study that involved HIV/sexually transmitted infection testing and the assessment of sexual behavioral characteristics. Two hundred thirty-nine eligible women were enrolled and followed up for 12 months. Baseline HIV prevalence at screening was 38.7% (95% CI: 34.2%-43.3%). The highest age-specific prevalence of HIV was 54.1% (95% CI: 46.3%-61.8%) seen in women aged 26 to 34 years. HIV incidence was 2.6% per 100 woman years. Pregnancy rates were high at 17.4 per 100 woman years (95% CI: 12.2-24.1).

Couples who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serodiscordant in Zambia were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study. From 1994 to 2002, both partners were seen quarterly and received physical exams including genital examinations. Separate rates for three outcome infections of interest (bacterial vaginosis, vaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis) were calculated. Bivariate associations between baseline and time-varying covariates and outcome infections of interest were evaluated using unadjusted Anderson-Gill survival models. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were generated using multivariable Anderson-Gill survival models that included demographic and clinical factors associated with both hormonal contraceptive use and each infection of interest. There were 1,558 cases of bacterial vaginosis, 1,529 cases of vaginal candidiasis, and 574 cases of trichomoniasis over 2,143 person-years of observation. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) users had significantly lower rates of trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis.

"Profile of patients and referrals at a midwife obstetric unit in Tshwane North subdistrict, Gauteng province",Horner V.; Mashamba T.J.,"Midwife obstetric units (MOUs) are primary health level facilities at which antenatal care and delivery for low-risk patients are performed. They are important facilities because they are at the interface of the health system in South Africa and the population. One of their main functions is the identifcation and referral of high-risk patients. However, few recent published studies describe the profle of patients utilising the services of MOUs and their referral data in detail in South Africa. The study design was a cohort study. Three hundred and nineteen patients reporting their pregnancies at the MOU were enrolled in the study, and were monitored for the duration of their pregnancies. 20.1% of the women were classifed as high risk at booking. Additionally, 18.2% were referred in labour. Of the high-risk patients, 21.2% of them delivered at the MOU. These women should have delivered at hospital and therefore presented a considerable risk for the MOU. 3.4% of women in the study delivered at home. This constitutes a signifcant risk for these women. Finally, the data showed the detailed distribution of risk factors, taken from history and examination, as well as important delivery information on the study patients. For example, 6.2% of the women had had a Caesarean section for a previous pregnancy, 2.8% had had pregnancy-induced hypertension, 1.5% tested positive for syphilis during their current pregnancy, and 1.8% developed severe anaemia.",2014,,Southern African Journal of Infectious Diseases,29,4,133-136,,10.1080/23120053.2014.11441587,,#3835,Horner 2014,Exclusion reason: 8.

Relationship between immunoclinical status and prevalence of viral sexually transmitted diseases among human immunodeficiency virus-1 seropositive patients in Ghana.,Brandful JA.; Apeagyei FA.; Ampofo WK.; Adu-Sarkodie Y.; Ansah JE.; Nuvor V.; Aidoo S.; Ishikawa K.; Sata T.; Yamamoto N.; Yamazaki S.,"In view of the strong association between the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), we screened 182 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected patients over a 15-month period for serological markers to previously encountered or current STDs, most of viral etiology. The relationship between their immunological and clinical status and the prevalence of STDs was assessed and compared with that of 88 HIV-seronegative patients. Hepatitis B virus and Treponema pallidum were the most frequently occurring pathogens in both HIV-1-infected and HIV-seronegative patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was also observed in both groups, but no HIV-seronegative patient was infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The Centers for Disease Control clinical staging of A1 through C3, representing asymptomatic to severe AIDS conditions, was observed in HIV-1 patients with or without STDs. A mean CD4 count of 288 cells per microliter (95% CI of 237-340 cells per microliter) in HIV-1 patients was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in HIV-seronegative individuals with 1019 cells per microliter (95% CI of 924-1115 cells per microliter), irrespective of whether subjects in either group had previous or current STDs. The mean CD4 count of patients with a single infection from HIV-1 was not significantly different (P = 0.36) from that of HIV-1 patients with multiple infections.

"Aetiology of sexually transmitted infections in Maputo, Mozambique.",Zimba TF.; Apalata T.; Sturm WA.; Moodley P.,"The study sought to ascertain the prevalence of the aetiological agents of genital discharge and genital ulcer diseases in Maputo, Mozambique. Consecutive consenting patients presenting to the Centro de Saúde do Porto in Maputo between March and April 2005 with genital discharge syndrome and/or genital ulcer diseases were recruited. Specimens were collected for the identification of STI pathogens. Of 346 recruited patients, 164 were male and 182 female. The prevalence of confirmed single aetiological agents for male urethritis was as follows: N. gonorrhoeae, 35%; C. trachomatis, 10%; and M. genitalium 4%. For vaginal discharge, N. gonorrhoeae was found in 11% of the women tested, followed by C. trachomatis (6.5%), bacterial vaginosis (34%), and T. vaginalis (2%). The prevalence of genital ulcers was as follows: Herpes simplex virus type 2, 62%; H. ducreyi 4 %; and C. trachomatis biovar LGV, 4%. Five percent of patients with genital ulcers had a positive syphilis serology (RPR ≥ 1:8 and confirmed by TPHA) and 35% of all tested patients were HIV-1/2 infected. Cases of mixed infections were present in 5%, 11% and 3% of patients with male urethritis, vaginal discharge, and genital ulcers respectively.

Design: Cross-sectional study, using standardized methods, including a standardized questionnaire and standardized laboratory tests, in four cities in sub-Saharan Africa: two with a high prevalence of HIV infection (Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia), and two with a relatively low prevalence of HIV (Cotonou, Benin and Yaoundé, Cameroon). Methods: In each city, a random sample of about 2000 adults aged 15-49 years was taken. Consenting men and women were interviewed about their socio-demographic characteristics and their sexual behaviour, and were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, and (women only) T. vaginalis infection. Risk factor analyses were carried out for trichomoniasis for each city separately. Multivariate analysis, however, was only possible for Yaoundé, Kisumu and Ndola. Results: The prevalence of trichomoniasis was significantly higher in the high HIV prevalence cities (29.3% in Kisumu and 34.3% in Ndola) than in Cotonou (3.2%) and Yaoundé (17.6%). Risk of trichomoniasis was increased in women who reported more lifetime sex partners. HIV infection was an independent risk factor for trichomonas infection in Yaoundé [adjusted odds ratio (OR)= 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9-3.7] and Kisumu (adjusted OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.7), but not in Ndola. A striking finding was the high prevalence (40%) of trichomonas infection in women in Ndola who denied that they had ever had sex. Conclusion: Trichomoniasis may have played a role in the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and may be one of the factors explaining the differences in levels of HIV infection between different regions in Africa. The differences in prevalence of trichomoniasis between the four cities remain unexplained, but we lack data on the epidemiology of trichomoniasis in men.

Cervical secretions and blood samples from study participants were sent to the National STD Reference Centre for diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, Treponema pallidum, and HIV. Overall, 34% of the study women were diagnosed with at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI) (3.1% N. gonorrhoeae, 6.2% C. trachomatis, 9.9% T. vaginalis, 6.7% T. pallidum, 12.2% HIV-1). In addition, 29.1% of women were diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and 46.6% with candidiasis. Only a small proportion of these women had sought treatment during the weeks before, despite the recognition of genital symptoms. Self-reported and health worker-recognized symptoms, signs and laboratory results exhibited only low sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values in the diagnosis of STIs. These findings confirm the high vulnerability of young African women to STIs and emphasize the need for specific control interventions which should include affordable and user-friendly services. Moreover, these results call for more effective quality control in case of laboratory-based STI control strategies and question the validity of syndromic STI management strategies in women attending antenatal care services in Africa.",1999,,International Journal of STD and AIDS,10,9,609-614,,10.1258/0956462991914753,,#2336,Blankhart 1999,Exclusion reason: 4.

HIV incidence was determined in 8089 HIV-negative subjects over 10 457 person years. Adjusted rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of HIV acquisition associated with genital ulcer disease (GUD) and discharge/dysuria were used to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of HIV acquisition. HIV transmission risks associated with STD symptoms in HIV-positive partners of 167 HIV discordant couples and the numbers of sexual partners reported by HIV-positive subjects were used to estimate the PAF of HIV transmission attributable to STD.

No significant differences were seen in PAF between study treatment arms. The PAF of HIV transmission associated with STD symptoms in HIV-positive persons was indirectly estimated to be 10.4%. In this mature, generalized HIV epidemic setting, most HIV seroconversion occurs without recognized STD symptoms or curable STD detected by screening.

Prevalence and risk factors associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among women of reproductive age in Swaziland.,Ginindza TG.; Stefan CD.; Tsoka-Gwegweni JM.; Dlamini X.; Jolly PE.; Weiderpass E.; Broutet N.; Sartorius B.,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain an important public health problem with approximately half a billion new cases annually among persons aged 15-49 years. Epidemiological data on STIs among women of reproductive age in Swaziland are limited. The availability of epidemiological data on STIs and associated risk factors in this population is essential for the development of successful prevention, diagnosis and management strategies in the country. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with STIs. A total of 655 women aged 15-49 years were systematically enrolled from five health facilities using a cross-sectional study design. Cervical specimen were tested using GeneXpert CT/NG Assays for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), GeneXpertTV Assay for Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and GeneXpert HPV Assays for hr-HPV. Blood samples were tested using Alere Determine HIV-1/2Ag/Ab Combo and Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold Recombigen HIV test for confirmation for HIV, and Rapid Plasma Reagin and TPHA test for confirmation for Treponema pallidum (syphilis). Genital warts were assessed prior to specimen collection. Survey weighted analyses were done to estimate the population burden of STIs. The four most common curable STIs: CT, NG, TV, Treponema pallidum (syphilis), as well as genital warts were considered in this study. The overall weighted prevalence of any of these five STIs was 19.4% (95% CI: 14.9-24.8), corresponding to 72 990 women with STIs in Swaziland. The estimated prevalences were 7.0% (95% CI: 4.1-11.2) for CT, 6.0% (95% CI: 3.8-8.8) for NG, 8.4% (95% CI: 5.4-12.8) for TV, 1.4% (95% CI: 1.1-10.2) for syphilis and 2.0% (95% CI: 1.0-11.4) for genital warts. The overall weighted HIV prevalence was 42.7% (95%CI: 35.7-46.2). Among hr-HPV positive women, 18.8% (95% CI: 13.1-26.3) had one STI, while 6.3% (95% CI: 3.3-11.7) had multiple STIs. Risk factors associated with STIs were being employed (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.0-4.7), self-employed (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.5-5.5) and being hr-HPV positive (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-3.1).

STIs are highly prevalent among women of reproductive age in Swaziland. Thus, a comprehensive STIs screening, surveillance and treatment programme would be justified and could potentially lower the burden of STIs in the country.",2017,,Infectious agents and cancer,12,,29,,10.1186/s13027-017-0140-y,28559923,#1257,Ginindza 2017,Exclusion reason: 7.

Factors affecting HIV concordancy in married couples in four African cities,"Freeman, E. E.; Glynn, J. R.; Lagarde, E.; Ferry, B.; Lydie, N.; Hayes, R.; Morison, L.; Weiss, H.; Glynn, J.; Robinson, N.; Study Grp Heterogeneity, H. I. V. Epidem","Objective: To determine risk factors for HIV transmission within married couples in four urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Data from a cross-sectional population-based study were used. Representative random samples approximating 1000 men and 1000 women in each of four cities of Kisumu (Kenya), Ndola (Zambia), Cotonou (Benin), and Yaounde (Cameroon), were interviewed and tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI). Married couples were identified as concordant negative, discordant, or concordant positive for each STI. After excluding concordant HIV negative couples, analysis of behavioural and STI risk factors for HIV positive concordancy was undertaken across the four cities and in each city separately where sample size allowed. Results: Among 221 couples in which at least one member was HIV positive, we found that the only significant risk factor for positive HIV concordancy was herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) status. After adjusting for age and city of residence the odds ratio for HIV concordancy compared to couples with neither spouse HSV-2 positive was 3.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-18.4) for couples with one partner HSV-2 positive and 8.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.6-45.0) for couples with both partners HSV-2 positive. The same trends were seen in Kisumu and Ndola when they were analysed separately (numbers were small in the other cities). Conclusions: Although cross-sectional studies are not ideal for delineating the sequence of transmission events, this study adds to the evidence that HSV-2 is a key risk factor in promoting HIV transmission.

"Measuring the impact of HIV and STIs in a community in a coal mining town, Mpumalanga, South Africa","Hurkchand, H.; Makuluma, H.; Molefe, N.; Molapo, M.","Background: A cross-sectional study was conducted in November 2001 to establish the prevalence rates of Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea) in a coalmining town in Mpumalanga. Methods: 155 adults were recruited (79 males and 76 females), by holding community meetings, and by door-to-door recruitment. Saliva and urine specimens were collected for the analysis of HIV and STI prevalence, respectively. Results: The mean age for males was 31.35 years (min = 19 yrs and max = 50 yrs) and the mean age of the female participants was 31.90 years (min = 17 yrs, max = 49 yrs). The prevalence of HIV was found to be 22.78% [95% CI (14.09-33.59)] in the males vs. 47.37% [95% CI (35.79-55.16)] in the females, [p = 0.001, OR = 3.05, 95% CI (1.49-6.26)]. The prevalence of C. trachomatis was 7.90% [95% CI (2.95-16.39)] in the males vs. 12.86% [95% CI (6.05-23.00)] in the females, p = 0.324. The prevalence of N. gonorrhoea was 3.79% [95% CI (0.79-1.08)] in the males vs. 9.86% [95% CI (4.06-19.26)] in the females, p = 0.137. HIV was significantly associated with C. trachomatis, [p = 0.032, OR = 3.18, 95% CI (1.04-9.72)], but was not significant when stratified by gender. HIV was not significantly associated with N. gonorrhoea (p = 0.072) but it was significantly associated when stratified by gender, p = 0.001 for females. There were no significant associations between HIV and age (p = 0.408), even upon stratification by gender. Conclusions: HIV prevalence in this community is high, and corresponds to national figures.

"Alcohol abuse, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted infections in women in Moshi urban district, northern Tanzania.",Ghebremichael M.; Paintsil E.; Larsen U.,"To assess the covariates of alcohol abuse and the association between alcohol abuse, high-risk sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Two thousand and nineteen women aged 20 to 44 were randomly selected in a 2-stage sampling from the Moshi urban district of northern Tanzania. Participant's demographic and socio-economic characteristics, alcohol use, sexual behaviors, and STIs were assessed. Blood and urine samples were drawn for testing of human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, and mycoplasma genitalium infections. Adjusted analyses showed that a history of physical (OR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.06-3.98) and sexual violence (OR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.05-2.51) was associated with alcohol abuse. Moreover, alcohol abuse was associated with number of sexual partners (OR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.01-2.73). Women who abused alcohol were more likely to report STIs symptoms (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.08-2.40). Women who had multiple sexual partners were more likely to have an STI (OR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.46-4.00) compared to women with 1 sexual partner. There was no direct association between alcohol abuse and prevalence of STIs (OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.55-1.34). However, alcohol abuse was indirectly associated with STIs through its association with multiple sexual partners. The findings of alcohol abuse among physically and sexually violated women as well as the association between alcohol abuse and a history of symptoms of STIs and testing positive for STIs have significant public health implications.

The natural history of HIV/AIDS in a major goldmining centre in South Africa: results of a biomedical and social survey,"Gilgen, D.; Williams, B. G.; MacPhail, C.; van Dam, C. J.; Campbell, C.; Ballard, R. C.; Taljaard, D.","This paper presents the results of a cross-sectional biomedical and social survey, conducted in a major goldmining centre with a high prevalence of HIV infection. It also provides the baseline data for a comprehensive intervention programme. Our sample comprised a stratified random group of migrant mineworkers and of the resident adult population living in the community close to the mines and a small convenience sample of sex workers. In total, 2231 people between 13 and 59 years of age were interviewed using a structured questionnaire covering a wide range of psychological, behavioural and social issues. Blood and urine samples were collected and tested for the presence of HIV and syphilis antibodies and infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The prevalence of HIV was high in all groups: 22% of the men and 37% of the women in the community, 29% of the mineworkers and 69% of the sex workers, were infected with HIV. The prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and especially syphilis, was also high in all four groups of people. Levels of migrancy were highest among mineworkers and sex workers. Migrants had a higher prevalence of casual partners than more permanent residents. More than 43 of the men in the study were circumcised and circumcision appears to offer some protection from HIV infection but not from other STIs. Knowledge about HIV was high but perceived vulnerability was low, which contributed to a high prevalence of unsafe behaviours. Social capital was also associated with HIV infection, with membership of sports clubs, youth clubs, burial societies and churches offering a protective effect against infection, while membership of stokvels (rotating credit associations) was associated with an increased chance of infection. Successful and sustainable intervention programmes must include a range of activities tailored to the needs of the community. Community-based peer education, focus group discussion and involvements of stakeholders should be complemented with syndromic management of STIs as well as periodic presumptive treatment of the sex workers, a partner notification system and training for local physicians.",2001,Sep-Oct,South African Journal of Science,97,9-10,387-392,WOS:000172816600015,,,#6744,Gilgen 2001,Exclusion reason: 4.

Prevalence of chlamydia among HIV positive and HIV negative patients in the Vhembe District as detected by real time PCR from urine samples.,Mafokwane TM.; Samie A.,"Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that has long plagued humanity as the most commonly contracted STD and is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. With the emergence of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases have also re-emerged as a grave public health problem, particularly in developing countries. Updated Information about the relative frequencies in developing countries is sparse. This study aims at establishing the relative occurrence of chlamydia using real time PCR technique in the Vhembe District of South Africa where reports on the prevalence of chlamydia are not available. A total of 243 Urine samples were collected from patients attending different ARV clinics in the Vhembe District and genomic DNA was purified using blood genomic DNA kit from Sigma-Aldrich. Real-Time PCR protocol targeting the 16S rRNA gene of C. trachomatis was used to confirm the presence of chlamydia among these patients. Demographic information as well as clinical data was collected as well. Of all the participants, 70.4% were females. The age varied from 19 to 72 years. The overall prevalence of chlamydia was 32.1%. The prevalence was significantly higher among females (39.2%) compared to males (15.5%) patients (P = 0.001) and was highest among pregnant women followed by patients who had reported any allergic reaction. Among the HIV positive patients, the prevalence was higher among those who were not taking ARV (38.1%) compared to those who were taking them (28.5%). The age group within which the highest prevalence was found was between 26-45 years. The present study shows a high prevalence of chlamydia among HIV and AIDS patients in the Vhembe District emphasizing the need to enhance STI control and particularly chlamydia among all young people. The particularly high prevalence of chlamydia among pregnant women is of great concern as this predisposes them to complications, while allergy migh predispose people to chlamydia infections.

High burden of STIs among HIV-infected adults prior to initiation of ART in South Africa: a retrospective cohort study.,Lurie MN.; Kirwa K.; Daniels J.; Berteler M.; Kalichman SC.; Mathews C.,"To assess the burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among HIV-positive South Africans in the period prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation compared with the period once on ART. We linked the clinic records of 1465 patients currently on ART to the electronic database which records all visits to city clinics. We used a mixed effects Poisson model to assess the relative rates of occurrence of treatment seeking for an STI in the periods prior to initiation of ART and while on ART. We accumulated 4214 person-years of follow-up, divided nearly equally between the pre-ART and on-ART periods. The rate of treatment seeking for new STIs was 5.50 (95% CI 5.43 to 5.78) per 100 person-years, and individuals had on average a sevenfold higher rate of seeking treatment for STIs in the period prior to initiating ART (9.57 per 100 person-years) compared with the period once on ART (5.5 per 100 person-years) (adjusted rate ratio (RR) 7.01, 95% CI 4.64 to 10.59). Being male (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.55) or younger (age <25) (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.65) was associated with higher incidence of clinic visits for STI treatment, while advanced stage of HIV disease (WHO stage 4) (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69) was associated with lower incidence. The period prior to the initiation of ART is a critical period where increased attention should be focused on the detection and treatment of STIs.

To determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and syphilis in pregnant women. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among women attending antenatal care clinics (ANCs). Blood samples were tested for syphilis using the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and treponemal haemagglutination (TPHA) tests; CT and NG were diagnosed using a manual polymerase chain reaction assay on first-void urine samples. A socio-demographic questionnaire was completed. Results were compared with previous published data on sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence in Mozambique. Results. Blood and urine samples were collected from 1119 and 835 women, respectively. The prevalence of CT was 4.1%, and that of NG 2.5%. The RPR test was positive in 5.2% of the women, and 7.1% had a positive TPHA test. Active syphilis was found in 4.7%. In univariate analysis, CT was associated with having had any level of education (p<0.05), reactive RPR and TPHA were associated with illiteracy (p<0.05), and TPHA was associated with age >25.

Syndromic treatment of sexually transmitted diseases reduces the proportion of incident HIV infections attributable to these diseases in rural Tanzania.,Orroth KK.; Gavyole A.; Todd J.; Mosha F.; Ross D.; Mwijarubi E.; Grosskurth H.; Hayes RJ.,"To compare the proportion of HIV seroconversions attributable to other sexually transmitted diseases in the intervention and comparison arms of the Mwanza sexually transmitted diseases (STD) intervention trial. Case-control study of 96 cases of HIV seroconversion and 974 HIV-negative controls, nested within the Mwanza trial cohort. Data on reported STD symptoms during 2 years of follow-up, and serological evidence of recent syphilis, were used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for HIV seroconversion, adjusted for community, age, marital status, sex partners and travel. Population-attributable fractions (PAF) of HIV seroconversions associated with these STD exposures were calculated separately for the intervention and comparison arms, and for men and women. In men in the comparison arm, adjusted ORs for ulcers (14.8), discharge (3.3), any symptom (4.1) and any STD (4.0) were highly significant. There were no significant associations between HIV incidence and STD exposures in the intervention arm. The PAF were consistently higher in the comparison arm than the intervention arm. In men, the PAF for any STD was 39.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.4-58.3)] in the comparison arm but only 12.0% (CI, 0.0-35.9) in the intervention arm. The PAF for women were lower than for men. These are minimal PAF estimates and they do not account for STD effects on HIV infectiousness. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of new HIV infections in men in the comparison arm were attributable to STD. Lower PAF in the intervention arm than in the comparison arm for men provide further evidence of the role of STD cofactors in HIV transmission, supporting the hypothesis that the Mwanza intervention reduced the duration of symptomatic STD, thus reducing the HIV risk associated with such STD.",2000,Jul,"AIDS (London, England)",14,10,1429-37,,10.1097/00002030-200007070-00017,10930159,#997,Orroth 2000,Exclusion reason: 4.

Comparison of vaginal speculum and nonspeculum specimens in the diagnosis of trichomonas vaginalis,Obunge O.; Oboro I.; Onyejepu N.; Alex-Wele M.,"Background Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide. In Nigeria, prevalence ranges from 5% to 15%. Apart from being a key biologic indicator of sexual activity, it's been associated with the transmission of Human Immunodeficiency virus. The use of vaginal speculum is traditionally required for specimen collection. The limited application of this step in various primary health care facilities in resource-poor settings due to difficulties with sterilization of speculae among others, has grossly reduced the offer of testing for Trichomoniasis. Self-collected vaginal swab could be an acceptable alternative specimen for diagnosis of trichomoniasis in low income settings. We compared the yield of Trichomonas vaginalis from speculum and non-speculum based specimens. Methods 500 women between 18-45 years presenting with abnormal vaginal discharge in two health care facilities in Rivers State, Nigeria, were enrolled. Three specimens were collected from each woman; two non-speculum based/noninvasive and the third, speculum based. Microscopists were trained and the procedure standardized. Wet mount microscopy was performed on all specimens within thirty minutes of collection. Three Microscopists examined each specimen independently. All infected patients were managed according to existing guidelines. Ethical approval was obtained and data analyzed using SPSS version 20. Results Median age of participants was 31 years. Of the 500 women, 53 were infected giving an overall prevalence of 10.6%. Using the speculum-based specimens, 90.5% (48) of infected women were detected while 83.0% (44) and 30.1% (16) were detected using the self-collected swab and first void urine respectively. Interestingly, first void urine was able to detect five (5) more cases that were not detected by the speculum- based method. Conclusion In low income settings, use of self-collected swabs in combination with first void urine is likely to increase detection rate of Trichomonas vaginalis when compared with the use of vaginal speculum only.",2019,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,95,"(Onyejepu N.)

"Is the fishing community a hotbed for HIV and STI transmission? Evidence from Mangochi, Malawi",Mwapasa V.,"Introduction Previous studies suggest that fishing communities are at high risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and could potentially serve as target populations for assessing the efficacy of novel HIV and STI interventions. We assessed the prevalence and incidence of HIV and STIs and risky sexual behaviour in a fishing community in Mangochi, southern Malawi. Methods We report baseline and 9-month follow-up data from an ongoing prospective cohort study which started in June 2009. We screened study participants for HIV, syphilis and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), using serological tests and assessed risky sexual behaviour using a questionnaire. We repeated these assessments at 3-monthly intervals in HIV-negative participants. Results We screened 740 participants with a median age of 26 years (IQ range: 22-32). Of these, 61.2% were female and 69.7% were married. The prevalence of HIV, syphilis and HSV-2 were 13.1%, 3.0% and 45.7%, respectively. Only HSV-2 infection was significantly more common in females than males (51.6% vs. 36.4%, P < 0.05). In the preceding 3 months, a history of genital sores and genital discharge were reported in 4.9% and 5.4% of all participants, respectively. Also, new sexual partnerships were reported in 18.8% of males and 5.5% of females. Overall, at 9 months, the cohort retention rate of HIV-negative participants was 80%. HIV, HSV-2 and syphilis incidence rates were 1, 11 and 4 per 1000 person-months, respectively. Five of the six new HIV cases originated from one village.

Bacterial vaginosis: Risk factors among Kenyan women and their male partners,Mbugua N.; Bukusi E.A.; Peter W.,"Introduction To simultaneously examine associations of bacterial vaginosis (BV) with potential risk factors in both the female and her male partner. Methods We recruited women 18-45 years of age and their male partners from clinics in Nairobi, Kenya. All underwent face-to-face standardised interview physical examination, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and syphilis serologic testing, endocervical cultures for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and vaginal swabs for diagnosis of BV by Gram stain and trichomoniasis by culture. Results Of 219 women, 97 (44%) had BV. BV was significantly associated by univariate analyses with women's own risk factors (young age, being unmarried, early sexual debut, more than 1 sexual partner, lifetime, rectal sex, trichomoniasis, HIV infection, and by principal components analysis, with low socioeconomic status [SES]) and also with male partners' characteristics (HIV infection, and by principal components analysis, low SES, and poor hygiene). In multivariate analysis including risk factors from both genders, the odds of having BV was 5.7 times higher if either partner was HIV seropositive, 13.2 times higher if the female had trichomoniasis, 2.5 times higher if the female had more than 1 sex partner ever, and decreased with increasing age of the female. Conclusion In this population, characteristics of males and of females were independently associated with BV.

The prevalences of HSV-2 antibody (91% vs. 78%, P = .02), HSV-2 shedding (43% vs. 22%, P = .003), and levels of HSV-2 DNA (P = .01) were all significantly higher among HIV-1-seropositive than among HIV-1-seronegative women. There was a significant correlation between genital HIV-1 RNA and HSV-2 DNA levels (P = .02) among the 23 women who were shedding HSV-2 DNA. If confirmed, such associations highlight the urgent need for HSV-2 control measures in populations at high risk of both infections.",2000,,Journal of Infectious Diseases,182,4,1090-1096,,10.1086/315836,,#2034,Mbopi-Keou 2000,Exclusion reason: 4.

Genital swabs were collected from 660 pregnant women and tested for a range of RTIs and for cervical cytology. Cervical HPV-DNA was detected by PCR and genotyped. HIV and syphilis serologies were performed. HPV prevalence was 34% (209/612 women). Of the 144 typeable samples, 83% were high risk (HR-HPV) oncogenic strains (56% HPV 16 related types). SIL was detected in 43 women (7%), with high grade SIL in 3%. There was a high prevalence of HIV (15%), and of any RTI (83%). Genital warts were detected in 20 women (3%). HPV infection was associated with some behavioural factors (short duration of relationship, single status, not using condoms) and gonorrhoea. There was no overall association between HPV and HIV (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.6-1.6), but a non-significant trend towards a stronger association with HR-HPV in women aged 15-19 (OR=2.79, 95% CI 0.8-9.5) and women aged > or =30 (OR=3.20, 95% CI 0.7-15). SIL was associated with HPV (OR=3.66, 95% CI 1.9-7.0), but not significantly with HIV (OR=1.54, 95% CI 0.7-3.4). Prevalence of SIL was higher among women dually positive for HPV/HIV compared to HPV infection only (21% v 12%), although this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.17).

Methods: Consecutive male (UDS/GUS) and female (VDS/GUS) patients were enrolled at Alexandra Health Centre, Johannesburg from January to April each year during 2007-2010. Urethral swabs (UDS), endocervical swabs/vaginal smears (VDS), genital ulcer swabs/smears (GUS) and sera (all) were collected with written informed consent. Real-time PCR assays were used to detect Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) from UDS/VDS swabs, and herpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum (TP) Haemophilus ducreyi (HD) and Chlamydia trachomatis L1-3 (LGV) from ulcer swabs. Slides were stained for bacterial vaginosis/candidiasis (BV/CA, VDS) and granuloma inguinale (GI, GUS). Sera were tested for syphilis (rapid plasmin reagin, RPR; Omega Diagnostics), for HSV-2 (HerpeSelect IgG; Focus Diagnostics) and for HIV (Determine; Abbott Laboratories). χ2 for linear trend analyses were undertaken with summary data (Prism v.2, GraphPad Software).

"Why do young women have a much higher prevalence of HIV than young men? A study in Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia",Glynn J.R.; Caraël M.; Auvert B.; Kahindo M.; Chege J.; Musonda R.; Kaona F.; Buvé A.,"Objective: To examine the factors responsible for the disparity in HIV prevalence between young men and women in two urban populations in Africa with high HIV prevalence. Design: Cross-sectional survey, aiming to include 1000 men and 1000 women aged 15-49 years in Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia. Methods: Participants were interviewed and tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Analyses compared the marital and non-marital partnership patterns in young men and women, and estimated the likelihood of having an HIV-infected partner. Results: Overall, 26% of individuals in Kisumu and 28% in Ndola were HIV-positive. In both sites, HIV prevalence in women was six times that in men among sexually active 15-19 year olds, three times that in men among 20-24 year olds, and equal to that in men among 25-49 year olds. Age at sexual debut was similar in men and women, and men had more partners than women. Women married younger than men and marriage was a risk factor for HIV, but the disparity in HIV prevalence was present in both married and unmarried individuals. Women often had older partners, and men rarely had partners much older than themselves. Nevertheless, the estimated prevalence of HIV in the partners of unmarried men aged under 20 was as high as that for unmarried women. HIV prevalence was very high even among women reporting one lifetime partner and few episodes of sexual intercourse. Conclusions: Behavioural factors could not fully explain the discrepancy in HIV prevalence between men and women. Despite the tendency for women to have older partners, young men were at least as likely to encounter an HIV-infected partner as young women. It is likely that the greater susceptibility of women to HIV infection is an important factor both in explaining the male-female discrepancy in HIV prevalence and in driving the epidemic. Herpes simplex virus type 2 infection, which is more prevalent in young women than in young men, is probably one of the factors that increases women's susceptibility to HIV infection. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2001,,AIDS,15,SUPPL. 4,S51-S60,,10.1097/00002030-200108004-00006,,#2118,Glynn 2001,Exclusion reason: 4.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake and early continuation among pregnant and post-partum women within maternal and child health clinics in Kenya: results from an implementation programme.,Kinuthia J.; Pintye J.; Abuna F.; Mugwanya KK.; Lagat H.; Onyango D.; Begnel E.; Dettinger J.; Baeten JM.; John-Stewart G.;  .,"Pregnant women in settings with high HIV prevalence are at increased risk of HIV acquisition and subsequent vertical transmission. We implemented and evaluated a novel programme to provide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in maternal and child health clinics in Kenya. In collaboration with Kisumu County Department of Health, we integrated PrEP delivery within 16 maternal and child health clinics in Kisumu County (Kenya). Women and girls older than 15 years seeking maternal and child health services who tested HIV negative at that visit or within a month and were willing to receive PrEP counselling were interviewed to assess for HIV behavioural risk factors and offered PrEP. Correlates of PrEP initiation and continuation were assessed using Poisson regression in univariate and multivariate analyses. Potential correlates included in our analyses were age, marital status, marriage type, whether pregnant or post partum, gestational age (if pregnant), and HIV risk factors in the previous 6 months. Reasons for the decision to discontinue after having decided to initiate PrEP were evaluated. Women who initiated PrEP were followed up 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation. Between Nov 20, 2017, and June 13, 2018, 9376 pregnant and post-partum women were assessed for behavioural risk factors and willingness to initiate PrEP. Overall, 2030 (21·7%) initiated PrEP, and 2027 had the status of their partner captured (153 [79·3%] of 193 women with partners living with HIV, 1178 [37·2%] of 3165 women with partners of unknown HIV status, and 696 [11·6%] of 5997 women with HIV-negative partners). Predictors of PrEP initiation in the multivariate analysis were: being younger than 24 years (adjusted prevalence ratio 1·14, 95% CI 1·02-1·28); having a partner living with HIV (6·96, 5·46-8·89) or of unknown HIV status (3·08, 2·50-3·81); gestational age of less than 26 weeks (1·22, 1·02-1·47); having been diagnosed or treated for a sexually transmitted infection (1·57, 1·20-2·06); having been forced to have sex (1·82, 1·38-2·42); having experienced intimate partner violence during the previous 6 months (1·65, 1·10-2·48); having shared needles while engaging in injection drug use (2·43, 1·69-3·50); and recurrent use of post-exposure prophylaxis (1·96, 1·36-2·82). Overall, 786 (38·7%) of 2030 women who initiated PrEP continued use after the first month, with 104 (68·0%) of 153 women who had a partner living with HIV continuing use. Having a partner living with HIV was the only predictor of PrEP continuation at 1 month in the multivariable model (1·98, 1·54-2·55). Frequent reasons for discontinuation were side effects and low HIV risk perception. No incident HIV infection was reported among women on PrEP. Many women attending maternal and child health clinics had risk factors for HIV and elected to use PrEP, indicating that routinely accessed maternal and child health clinics can be an effective platform for PrEP delivery for young women. As PrEP awareness rises, PrEP provision in routine clinical settings such as maternal and child health facilities might contribute to decreased HIV incidence among young women.

Methods: For the purpose of cervical cancer screening, cytology and HR HPV polymerase chain reaction data were collected from 324 women aged between 30 and 60 years. Microscopy and gram stains were used to detect yeast and bacterial vaginosis. Cervical nucleic acid amplification test specimens were collected for the detection of Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Results: The majority of women were married (320 of 324) and reported having a single sexual partner (270 of 324); the median age of participants was 41 years. HR HPV was detected in 42 participants. Forty-seven percent of women had vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis was the most common infection (32.4%), followed by TV (10.4%), and yeast (6.8%).

"Risk factors for HIV infection among special treatment clinic attendees in Ibadan, Nigeria.",Kehinde AO.; Lawoyin TO.; Bakare RA.,"Control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is an important factor in the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV infection. Despite a close link between the two disease entities, not enough data are however available on risk factors for HIV infection among STI clinic patients in Nigeria. This information is important for planning preventive measures. All consenting patients that attended special treatment clinic (STC), University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan from March to November 2001 were enrolled into the study. Using a structured interview assisted questionnaire, information on socio-demographic characteristics, sexual and reproductive history and other potential risk factors for HIV infection were obtained. Urethral swab, endocervical swab and high vaginal swab were also obtained and processed by standard laboratory methods. HIV tests were carried out by double ELISA tests. Of the 210 subjects, 180 (85.7%) were diagnosed as having STI while 46 (21.9%) screened positive for HIV. Co-infection was found in 41(19.5%) of all subjects. The risk of HIV was higher in subjects with STIs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that subjects who were not infected with gonorrhoea (OR = 0.685, 95% CI = 0.47- 0.99, p = 0.045) and those with negative history of blood transfusion (OR= 0.1,95% CI = 0.02-0.5, p=0.009) were less at risk of HIV infection while those with lower occupation had a higher risk (OR = 1.126,95% CI = 0.32-3.9, p = 0.085). The results of this study emphasize the need for adequate management of STIs and the importance of upgrading blood transfusion services in order to curtail the spread of HIV infection.",2004,Sep,African journal of medicine and medical sciences,33,3,229-34,,,15819469,#183,Kehinde 2004,Exclusion reason: 5.

Should family planning clinics provide clinical services for sexually transmitted infections? A case study from Cote d'Ivoire,"Lafort, Y.; Sawadogo, Y.; Delvaux, T.; Vuylsteke, B.; Laga, M.","OBJECTIVES To evaluate the quality and usefulness of integrated sexually transmitted infection (STI) care at non-governmental family planning (FP) clinics in Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS Evaluation components included: (1) a survey measuring the prevalence of STI and the predictive value of the Ivorian vaginal discharge treatment algorithm, (2) client exit interviews, (3) direct observations of client-provider contacts, (4) the monitoring of the clinics' workload and available equipment and supplies and (5) interviews of programme managers and FP providers. RESULTS Among 368 FP clients surveyed, the prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, B. vaginosis and Candida albicans were respectively 1.6, 5.7, 7.1, 44.8 and 5.2%. The positive predictive value of the national algorithm for the detection of cervicitis was only 6.3%, and was 17.9% among a subgroup of young, single women. Of 200 clients interviewed, 96% were satisfied with the services and 95% would return to the FP clinic if they had genital problems. In 215 observed client-provider contacts, 88% of 94 STI cases were correctly managed. Programme managers and providers reported no substantial work overload as a result of the integration of STI services. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of cervical infections is relatively low in this population and the Ivorian algorithm that treats all women with vaginal discharge performs poorly. Over-treatment of cervicitis can be reduced by modifying the algorithm, although improved diagnostic tools are urgently needed to detect cervicitis in this population. Continued STI case management at the FP clinics is nevertheless justified because there exists an easily identifiable group of higher risk women who need STI care; and because of the demand by a large proportion of clients, the high prevalence of vaginal pathogens, and the limited costs to the FP programme.",2003,Jun,Tropical Medicine & International Health,8,6,552-560,WOS:000183348900009,10.1046/j.1365-3156.2003.01065.x,,#6214,Lafort 2003,Exclusion reason: 6.

Contraceptive Preference Among Women at Risk of HIV Acquisition in a Preparatory Screening Study for a Phase III Microbicide Trial in South Western Uganda.,Kusemererwa S.; Abaasa A.; Onyango M.; Nel AM.; Isaacs M.; Asiki G.,"Contraceptive preferences of women at risk for HIV acquisition are not well documented. We report on contraceptive choices among women residing in small townships in southwestern Uganda. This was part of preparatory efforts for recruitment into the Ring Study, a phase 3 microbicide trial, between July 2013 and October 2014. Clinicians provided contraceptives per a woman's choice. HIV testing and screening for other sexually transmitted infections were done at first contact and at screening for the trial. Contraceptive choice was summarized by demographics and regression analysis to show factors associated with use of the injectable method. Of 6725 women contacted, 489 were prescreened. Of these 489 women, most (306, 63%) were already using contraception. Injectables were most preferred (58.7%), followed by implants (23.9%). Women living with a regular sexual partner preferred the injectable method (61.0%, P = 0.06), compared with other methods.

The burden and risk factors of Sexually Transmitted Infections and Reproductive Tract Infections among pregnant women in Zimbabwe,Kurewa N.E.; Mapingure M.P.; Munjoma M.W.; Chirenje M.Z.; Rusakaniko S.; Stray-Pedersen B.,"Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and Reproductive tract infections (RTIs) are responsible for high morbidity among women. We aim to quantify the magnitude of the burden and risk factors of STI/RTI s among pregnant women in Zimbabwe.Methods: A cross sectional study of pregnant women enrolled at 36 weeks of gestation from the national PMTCT program. Study was conducted from three peri-urban clinics around Harare Zimbabwe offering maternal and child health services.Results: A total of 691 pregnant women were enrolled. Prevalence of HSV was (51.1%), HIV (25.6%) syphilis (1.2%), Trichomonas vaginalis (11.8%), bacterial vaginosis (32.6%) and Candidiasis (39.9%). Seven percent of the women had genital warts, 3% had genital ulcers and 28% had an abnormal vaginal discharge. Prevalence of serological STIs and vaginal infections were 51% and 64% respectively.Risk factors for a positive serologic STI were increasing age above 30 years, polygamy and multigravid; adjusted OR (95% CI) 2.61(1.49-4.59), 2.16(1.06-4.39), 3.89(1.27-11.98) respectively, partner taking alcohol and number of lifetime sexual partners. For vaginal infections it was age at sexual debut; OR (95% CI) 1.60(1.06-2.42). More than 25% of the women reported previous STI treatment. Fifty two percent reported ever use of condoms and 65% were on oral contraceptives. Mean age gap for sexual partners was 6.3 years older.Conclusions: There is a high morbidity of STI/RTIs in this cohort.

Linking HIV prevention and care for community interventions among high-risk women in Burkina Faso-the ARNS 1222 yerelon cohort,Konate I.; Traore L.; Ouedraogo A.; Sanon A.; Diallo R.; Ouedraogo J.-L.; Huet C.; Millogo I.; Andonaba J.-B.; Mayaud P.; Van De Perre P.; Nagot N.,"Background: Interventions targeting core groups such as high-risk women in Africa have focused mostly on HIV prevention. In this marginalized group, the delegation of HIV care to public services may jeopardize the effectiveness of prevention activities. We assessed the effect of an intervention combining prevention and care among high-risk women on HIV exposure and treatment outcomes. Methods In Burkina Faso, high-risk women were recruited by peer educators in an open-cohort study with 4-monthly follow-up visits. Primary prevention included peer-led information, education and communication sessions, condom distribution, regular HIV counselling and testing, and sexually transmitted infections management. Participants were offered free medical care including antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatment adherence support by psychologists. Results: From December 2003, 658 high-risk women were enrolled and followed up for a median 20.8 months. Seven of the 489 HIV-uninfected women seroconverted (HIV incidence 0.9 of 100 person-years, 95% confidence interval: 0.24 to 1.58). HIV incidence tended to be higher during the first 8 months of follow-up than thereafter (1.43 vs. 0.39 per 100 person-years). Among 47 of 169 HIV-seropositive women who started ART, 79.4% achieved undetectable plasma viral load 6 months after initiation and 81.8% at 36 months. Condom use at last sexual intercourse with clients increased from 81.7% at enrollment to 98.2% at 12 months (P < 0.001) and from 67.2% to 95.9% (P < 0.001) with regular clients. Conclusions: The integration of HIV care services, including the provision and support of ART, with a peer-led primary prevention package is pivotal to reduce HIV incidence and is likely to modify the local HIV dynamics.

The study was part of a larger community-based, cross-sectional survey with an eligible female population of 1993. All were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-tested and asked whether they were circumcised (n = 1678; 84.2%). Participants aged 15-44 years were interviewed (n = 636; 79.7%), and 399 (50.0%) were gynaecologically examined to screen for STIs and determine the FGC status. At a mean age of 9.6 years, 45.2% reported being circumcised. In the age-group 15-44 years, 65.5% reported being cut, while FGC was observed in 72.5% and categorized as clitoridectomy or excision. The strongest predictors of FGC were ethnicity and religion, i.e. being a Protestant or a Muslim. FGC was not associated with HIV infection, other STIs or infertility. A positive, non-significant association between FGC and bacterial vaginosis was found with a crude odds ratio of 4.6. There was a significant decline of FGC over the last generation. An inconsistency between self-reported and clinically determined FGC status was observed in more than one-fifth of the women. The data indicate that both women and clinicians might incorrectly report women's circumcision status. This reveals methodological problems in determining women's circumcision status in populations practising the most common type of FGC.

Our objective was to investigate the associations between depression, IPV, and alcohol use and HIV-risk indicators among a sample of outpatients in rural Uganda, and the effect of co-occurrence of these factors on HIV-risk indicators. In a structured interview we collected data on high-risk sexual behavior, depression symptoms, emotional and physical IPV, and alcohol use, as well as a blood sample for HIV and syphilis tests and a urine sample for chlamydia and gonorrhea tests from 325 male and female outpatients receiving provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) at a public hospital outpatient clinic in rural Uganda. We used logistic regression and generalized linear modeling to test independent associations between depression, IPV, and alcohol use and HIV-risk indicators, as well as the effect of co-occurrence on HIV-risk indicators. Twelve percent of men and 15% of women had two or more of the following conditions: depression, IPV, and alcohol use; another 29% of men and 33% of women had 1 condition. Each condition was independently associated with HIV risk behavior for men and women, and for women, depression was associated with testing positive for HIV or a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Men with one condition (AOR 2.32, 95% CI 1.95-2.77) and two or more conditions (AOR 12.77, 95% CI 7.97-20.47) reported more high risk sex acts compared to those with no potential co-occurring conditions. For men, experiencing two or more conditions increased risky sex more than one alone (χ 2 24.68, p < 0.001). Women experiencing one condition (AOR 3.33, 95% CI 137-8.08) and two co-occurring conditions (AOR 5.87, 95% CI 1.99-17.35) were more likely to test positive for HIV or an STI and women with two co-occurring conditions were also at increased risk for risky sex (AOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.64-2.91). We also found preliminary evidence suggesting synergistic effects between depression and emotional IPV and between alcohol use and depression. This study demonstrates the co-occurrence of depression, IPV, and alcohol use in men and women in an outpatient setting in rural Uganda.

A.","Objectives Reproductive tract infections (RTIs), including sexually acquired, among adolescent girls is a public health concern, but few studies have measured prevalence in low-middle-income countries. The objective of this study was to examine prevalence in rural schoolgirls in Kenya against their reported symptoms. Methods In 2013, a survey was conducted in 542 adolescent schoolgirls aged 14-17 years who were enrolled in a menstrual feasibility study. Vaginal self-swabbing was conducted after girls were interviewed face-to-face by trained nurses on symptoms. The prevalence of girls with symptoms and laboratory-confirmed infections, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of symptoms compared with laboratory results, were calculated. Results Of 515 girls agreeing to self-swab, 510 answered symptom questions. A quarter (24%) reported one or more symptoms; most commonly vaginal discharge (11%), pain (9%) or itching (4%). Laboratory tests confirmed 28% of girls had one or more RTI. Prevalence rose with age; among girls aged 1617 years, 33% had infections. Bacterial vaginosis was the most common (18%), followed by Candida albicans (9%), Chlamydia trachomatis (3%), Trichomonas vaginalis (3%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1%). Reported symptoms had a low sensitivity and positive predictive value. Three-quarters of girls with bacterial vaginosis and C. albicans, and 50% with T. vaginalis were asymptomatic.

Spearman's correlation was used to assess the relationship between HIV prevalence and each variable. There was a positive association between HIV prevalence and HSV-2, symptomatic STIs and high-risk sex (sex with a non-cohabiting, non-marital partner) for women. Non-significant positive associations were present between HIV and high-risk sex for men and lifetime number of partners for men and women.

Expanded safety and acceptability of the candidate vaginal microbicide Carraguard® in South Africa., .,"Carraguard's safety and acceptability was assessed among women in Gugulethu and Ga-Rankuwa, South Africa. A randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind trial was conducted in HIV-negative, nonpregnant women who inserted Carraguard or placebo at least three times a week, including before vaginal sex, for 6 to 12 months. Monthly visits included pelvic examination, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing/treatment and HIV counseling/testing. Acceptability was assessed quarterly. Of 400 women (205 Carraguard, 195 placebo) enrolled, 328 (77%) completed at least 6 months. Incidence of genital epithelial disruption was similar between the Carraguard (13.6 per 100 woman-years) and placebo (21.3 per 100 woman-years) groups (relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.10); there were no significant differences in rates of HIV/STI, though the study was not powered to determine effectiveness. Only 2% of adverse events were judged possibly related to (either) gel. More than 94% of women reported at least once liking the gel very much. Carraguard was not associated with more vaginal, cervical or external genital irritation than placebo, and it was acceptable when used approximately 3.5 times per week, including during sex.",2010,Dec,Contraception,82,6,563-71,,10.1016/j.contraception.2010.04.019,21074021,#1126,,Exclusion reason: Data collection occurred prior to 1998; ,""
Reduced fertility associated with HIV: the contribution of pre-existing subfertility.,Ross A.; Morgan D.; Lubega R.; Carpenter LM.; Mayanja B.; Whitworth JA.,"HIV-1 infection is associated with lower fertility among women in sub-Saharan Africa and this association is not explained by the frequency of sexual intercourse, illness, knowledge of HIV status or infection with other sexually transmitted diseases. Women with fertility problems are at increased risk of marital instability and, therefore, HIV infection; consequently, pre-existing subfertility among HIV-infected women may contribute to the association. This study examines the relationship between HIV-1 infection and the incidence of recognised pregnancy and the role of low gravidity prior to seroconversion in rural Uganda. A group of 176 women (80 HIV infected and 96 uninfected) were enrolled into an HIV-1 natural history cohort and invited to attend 3-monthly clinic appointments. Data from clinic visits were analysed to assess the independent effects of HIV infection and age, lactation, illness, reported frequency of sexual intercourse and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) on the risk of pregnancy in the following 3 months. The number of previous pregnancies was recorded at enrolment, and the effect of gravidity was examined for the subgroup of women who were uninfected at enrolment or who enrolled within 2 years of their estimated seroconversion date. During follow-up, 124 pregnancies were observed in 83 women beginning in the 3 months following 47 (7.0%) of 669 visits made by HIV-infected women and 77 (9.5%) of 812 visits by HIV-negative women (P = 0.12). Adjusting for age, lactation, illness, STD and the reported frequency of sexual intercourse, the estimated reduction in the risk of pregnancy associated with HIV infection was 47% [95% confidence interval (CI) 18-66]. Pre-existing low gravidity was strongly associated with a reduced incidence of pregnancy (odds ratio 0.39; CI 0.19-0.81). Additionally, adjusting for low gravidity reduced the estimate of the effect of HIV infection by almost a half, to 25% (95% CI-57-29). Low gravidity prior to seroconversion accounts for almost 50% of the observed association between HIV infection and lowered incidence of pregnancy, after adjusting for age, lactation, illness, STD and the frequency of sexual intercourse.",1999,Oct,"AIDS (London, England)",13,15,2133-41,,10.1097/00002030-199910220-00017,10546867,#151,Ross 1999,Exclusion reason: Data collection occurred prior to 1998; ,""
Condom use and its associations with HIV/sexually transmitted diseases in four urban communities of sub-Saharan Africa,"Lagarde, E.; Auvert, B.; Chege, J.; Sukwa, T.; Glynn, J. R.; Weiss, H. A.; Akam, E.; Laourou, M.; Carael, M.; Buve, A.; Study Grp Heterogeneity, H. I. V. Epidem","Objectives: To estimate rates of condom use in four urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa and to assess their association with levels of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Methods: Data were obtained from a multicentre study of factors that determine the differences in rate of spread of HIV in four African cities. Consenting participants were interviewed on sexual behaviour, and also provided blood and urine samples for testing for HIV infection and other STDs. Data on sexual behaviour included information on condom use during all reported spousal and non-spousal partnerships in the past 12 months. Results: A total of 2116 adults aged 15-49 years were interviewed in Cotonou (Benin), 2089 in Yaounde (Cameroon), 1889 in Kisumu (Kenya) and 1730 in Ndola (Zambia). Prevalence rates of HIV infection were 3.4% in Cotonou, 5.9% in Yaounde, 25.9% in Kisumu and 28.4% in Ndola. Reported condom use was low, with the proportions of men and women who reported frequent condom use with all non-spousal partners being 21-25% for men and 11-24% for women. A higher level of condom use by city was not associated with lower aggregate level of HIV infection. The proportions of men reporting genital pain or discharge during the past 12 months were significantly lower among those reporting frequent condom use in all sites except Yaounde: in Cotonou, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.09-0.94; in Kisumu, adjusted OR = 0.34, 95% Cl = 0.14-0.83; and in Ndola, adjusted OR = 0.33, 95% Cl = 0.12-0.90. The same association was found for reported genital ulcers in two sites only: in Cotonou, adjusted OR = 0.14, 95% Cl = 0.02-1.02; and in Kisumu, adjusted OR = 0.18, 95% Cl = 0.04-0.75. There were few statistically significant associations between condom use and biological indicators of HIV infection or other STDs in any of the cities. Conclusion: Similar levels of condom use were found in all four populations, and aggregate levels of condom use by city could not discriminate between cities with high and low level of HIV infection. It seems that rates of condom use may not have been high enough to have a strong impact on HIV/STD levels in the four cities. At an individual level, only a male history of reported STD symptoms was found to be consistently associated with lower rates of reported condom use.

The burden and risk factors of Sexually Transmitted Infections and Reproductive Tract Infections among pregnant women in Zimbabwe.,Kurewa NE.; Mapingure MP.; Munjoma MW.; Chirenje MZ.; Rusakaniko S.; Stray-Pedersen B.,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and Reproductive tract infections (RTIs) are responsible for high morbidity among women. We aim to quantify the magnitude of the burden and risk factors of STI/RTI s among pregnant women in Zimbabwe. A cross sectional study of pregnant women enrolled at 36 weeks of gestation from the national PMTCT program. Study was conducted from three peri-urban clinics around Harare Zimbabwe offering maternal and child health services. A total of 691 pregnant women were enrolled. Prevalence of HSV was (51.1%), HIV (25.6%) syphilis (1.2%), Trichomonas vaginalis (11.8%), bacterial vaginosis (32.6%) and Candidiasis (39.9%). Seven percent of the women had genital warts, 3% had genital ulcers and 28% had an abnormal vaginal discharge. Prevalence of serological STIs and vaginal infections were 51% and 64% respectively. Risk factors for a positive serologic STI were increasing age above 30 years, polygamy and multigravid; adjusted OR (95% CI) 2.61(1.49-4.59), 2.16(1.06-4.39), 3.89(1.27-11.98) respectively, partner taking alcohol and number of lifetime sexual partners. For vaginal infections it was age at sexual debut; OR (95% CI) 1.60(1.06-2.42). More than 25% of the women reported previous STI treatment. Fifty two percent reported ever use of condoms and 65% were on oral contraceptives. Mean age gap for sexual partners was 6.3 years older. There is a high morbidity of STI/RTIs in this cohort. There is need to continuously screen, counsel, treat and monitor trends of STI/RTIs to assess if behaviour changes lead to reduction in infections and their sustainability.",2010,May,BMC infectious diseases,10,,127,,10.1186/1471-2334-10-127,20492681,#1627,Kurewa 2010,Exclusion reason: 1.

Colposcopic appearance of female genital schistosomiasis,Kleppa E.; Norseth H.M.; Lillebø K.; Taylor M.; Gundersen S.G.; Onsrud M.; Kjetland E.F.,"Objectives: Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) is caused by the water-transmitted parasite S. haematobium and its deposition of ova in the genital tissues. More than 200 million people are infected with schistosomiasis worldwide and up to 75% of women with urinary schistosomiasis have parasite ova in their genitals, both on the ecto and the endocervix. The VIBE-study intends to determine clinical findings of FGS, HIV association and effect of treatment. We here aim to describe the colposcopic picture of FGS lesions found in a young South African population. Materials: The study is conducted in the Ugu district of KwaZulu- Natal, South Africa. Young women above the age of 16 years, in the highest school grades and sexually active, are examined. Methods: The study is school based, cluster randomized and cross-sectional. Participants are interviewed, and gynecological examination with photocolposcopy is done. Samples (urine, blood and vaginal lavage) for laboratory analysis for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and S. haematobium are collected. Results: The study is ongoing and only the colposcopic manifestations of FGS are presented here. Typical findings of parasitologically verified FGS are grainy- and homogenous sandy patches, pathologic vessels and mucosal bleedings. The predilection site is in or near to the transitional zone on the cervix. Conclusions: FGS is common in areas endemic for S. haematobium and represents an important differential diagnosis against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, condylomas and STIs. Colposcopists need to know more about FGS. Genital lesions might have consequences for fertility and susceptibility to HIV, and symptoms can mimic those of malignancy.

However, little is known about the reach and effect of these strategies in some communities. We did a cross-sectional community survey in the adjacent Greater Edendale and Vulindlela areas in the uMgungundlovu district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Using a multistage cluster sampling method, we randomly selected enumeration areas, households, and individuals. One household member (aged 15-49 years) selected at random was invited for survey participation. After obtaining consent, questionnaires were administered to obtain sociodemographic, psychosocial, and behavioural information, and exposure to HIV prevention and treatment programmes. Clinical samples were collected for laboratory measurements. Statistical analyses were done accounting for multilevel sampling and weighted to represent the population. A multivariable logistic regression model assessed factors associated with HIV infection. Between June 11, 2014, and June 22, 2015, we enrolled 9812 individuals. The population-weighted HIV prevalence was 36·3% (95% CI 34·8-37·8, 3969 of 9812); 44·1% (42·3-45·9, 2955 of 6265) in women and 28·0% (25·9-30·1, 1014 of 3547) in men (p<0·0001). HIV prevalence in women aged 15-24 years was 22·3% (20·2-24·4, 567 of 2224) compared with 7·6% (6·0-9·3, 124 of 1472; p<0·0001) in men of the same age. Prevalence peaked at 66·4% (61·7-71·2, 517 of 760) in women aged 35-39 years and 59·6% (53·0-66·3, 183 of 320) in men aged 40-44 years. Consistent condom use in the last 12 months was 26·5% (24·1-28·8, 593 of 2356) in men and 22·7% (20·9-24·4, 994 of 4350) in women (p=0·0033); 35·7% (33·4-37·9, 1695 of 5447) of women's male partners and 31·9% (29·5-34·3, 1102 of 3547) of men were medically circumcised (p<0·0001), and 45·6% (42·9-48·2, 1251 of 2955) of women and 36·7% (32·3-41·2, 341 of 1014) of men reported antiretroviral therapy (ART) use (p=0·0003). HIV viral suppression was achieved in 54·8% (52·0-57·5, 1574 of 2955) of women and 41·9% (37·1-46·7, 401 of 1014) of men (p<0·0001), and 87·2% (84·6-89·8, 1086 of 1251) of women and 83·9% (78·5-89·3, 284 of 341; p=0·3670) of men on ART. Age, incomplete secondary schooling, being single, having more than one lifetime sex partner (women), sexually transmitted infections, and not being medically circumcised were associated with HIV-positive status. The HIV burden in specific age groups, the suboptimal differential coverage, and uptake of HIV prevention strategies justifies a location-based approach to surveillance with finer disaggregation by age and sex.

"Association of age at first sex with HIV-1, HSV-2, and other sexual transmitted infections among women in northern Tanzania.",Ghebremichael M.; Larsen U.; Paintsil E.,"To examine the association between age at first sex and the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV-1 and HSV-2, in women in Moshi urban district, northern Tanzania. A total of 2019 women aged 20 to 44 were randomly selected in a 2-stage sampling from Moshi urban district, northern Tanzania. Information on demographics and sexual behaviors were obtained. Blood and urine samples were drawn for testing of HIV-1, HSV-2, and other STIs. Women who had their first sexual intercourse at age between 18 and 19 (OR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.50-0.86) or 20+ (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.36-0.60) were less likely to have STIs, including HIV-1 and HSV-2, than women who had their first intercourse before their 18th birthday. The hazards of having had first sex at an earlier age were significantly higher for women who tested positive for STIs (HR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.37-1.69) or had STI symptoms (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05-1.30). Early age at first sex was associated with having a regular noncohabiting partner (HR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.23-1.58), female circumcision (HR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.02-1.40), and coercion at first intercourse (HR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.15-1.89). In sub-Saharan Africa, where the prevalence of HIV and other STIs is high, a better understanding of the determinants of the age at first sex is crucial for HIV/STI prevention programs.

Factors affecting HIV concordancy in married couples in four African cities.,Freeman EE.; Glynn JR.;  .,"To determine risk factors for HIV transmission within married couples in four urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Data from a cross-sectional population-based study were used. Representative random samples approximating 1000 men and 1000 women in each of four cities of Kisumu (Kenya), Ndola (Zambia), Cotonou (Benin), and Yaoundé (Cameroon), were interviewed and tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI). Married couples were identified as concordant negative, discordant, or concordant positive for each STI. After excluding concordant HIV negative couples, analysis of behavioural and STI risk factors for HIV positive concordancy was undertaken across the four cities and in each city separately where sample size allowed. Among 221 couples in which at least one member was HIV positive, we found that the only significant risk factor for positive HIV concordancy was herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) status. After adjusting for age and city of residence the odds ratio for HIV concordancy compared to couples with neither spouse HSV-2 positive was 3.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-18.4) for couples with one partner HSV-2 positive and 8.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.6-45.0) for couples with both partners HSV-2 positive. The same trends were seen in Kisumu and Ndola when they were analysed separately (numbers were small in the other cities).

The objectives of this study were to investigate the association between BV and sexual debut, to investigate other potential risk factors of BV and to estimate associations between BV and STIs. Secondary school girls in Mwanza, aged 17 and 18 years, were invited to join a cross-sectional study. Consenting participants were interviewed and samples were obtained for STI and BV testing. Factors associated with prevalent BV were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Y-chromosome was tested as a biomarker for unprotected penile-vaginal sex. Of the 386 girls who were enrolled, 163 (42%) reported having ever had penile-vaginal sex. Ninety-five (25%) girls had BV. The prevalence of BV was 33% and 19% among girls who reported or did not report having ever had penile-vaginal sex, respectively. BV was weakly associated with having ever had one sex partner (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.59;95% CI 0.93 to 2.71) and strongly associated with two or more partners (aOR = 3.67; 95% CI 1.75 to 7.72), receptive oral sex (aOR 6.38; 95% CI 1.22 to 33.4) and having prevalent human papillomavirus infection (aOR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.95). Of the 223 girls who reported no penile-vaginal sex, 12 (5%) tested positive for an STI and 7 (3%) tested positive for Y-chromosome. Reclassifying these positive participants as having ever had sex did not change the key results. Tanzanian girls attending school had a high prevalence of BV. Increasing number of sex partner was associated with BV; however, 19% of girls who reported no penile-vaginal sex had BV.

Reproductive health needs of young persons in markets and motor parks in south west Nigeria.,Dare OO.; Oladepo O.; Cleland JG.; Badru OB.,"The aim of the study was to assess the reproductive health needs of out-of-school males and females aged 12-26 years working in markets and motor parks in Ibadan using Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and a survey questionnaire. Result revealed that sexual experience was higher among males (80%) compared to females (66%). Multiple concurrent sexual partnerships were found to be common among unmarried young men (71%) than women (51%) but means to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease (STD) were rarely employed. The knowledge of HIV was high (70%) though very few (12%) were aware that an infected individual would remain asymtomatic. Moreover, 36.5% thought that condoms make sex less enjoyable. Between 6 and 9% used a method for disease prevention within marriage or regular partnerships compared to 16% in casual contacts. Despite high exposure to risk, the prevalence of STDs was low as only 4% of the sexually experienced males and 9% of females were infected with Candida Albicans, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginitis or Neisseria gonorrhea.

HIV is primarily transmitted across the genital mucosa and preferentially infects CD4+ T-cells. We investigated the influence of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) on CD4+ T-cell activation and inflammation in the genital tracts of adolescents from South Africa. Methods Cervical cytobrush mononuclear cells were isolated from 148 adolescents (16-22 years) from Cape Town, and expression of T-cell activation and proliferation markers (CD38, HLA-DR, Ki67, CCR5) was measured by FACs. Adolescents were screened for BV (Nugent) and STIs (C. trachomatis, N. gonnorhoea, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium, HSV-2) by PCR. For comparison, 11 HIV-negative adult women were included. Concentrations of 48 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were measured in matching menstrual cups by Luminex. Results Adolescents (median 18 years; IQR 17-20) had significantly higher frequencies of activated CD4+ T-cells (CD38+, HLADR+, CD38+HLADR+: each p < 0.0001) from cervical cytobrushes than adults although CCR5 expression was higher in adults. STIs and BV prevalence was very high, with 71% of adolescents having ≥1 STI and/or BV, and 42% being C. trachomatis positive. Adolescents with an STI, despite these being asymptomatic, had higher frequencies of activated and proliferating T-cells compared to those with no STI/BV (CD4+CD38+HLADR+: p = 0.047; CD4+Ki67+: p = 0.020). Women positive for chlamydia had significantly higher frequencies of CD4+CD38+ T-cells (p = 0.006). Women with both STIs and BV had the most pronounced increase in CD4+ T-cell activation (CD38+: p = 0.002; CD38+HLADR+: p = 0.001; Ki67+: p = 0.002). Higher cervical T-cell activation marker expression was directly associated with increased genital cytokine profiles.

Design: Cross-sectional study, using standardized methods, including a standardized questionnaire and standardized laboratory tests, in four cities in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: In each city, a random sample of about 2000 adults aged 15-49 years was taken. Consenting men and women were interviewed about their socio-demographic characteristics and their sexual behaviour, and were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, and (women only) Trichomonas vaginalis infection. Risk factor analyses were carried out for chlamydial infection and syphilis seroreactivity. Results: The prevalence of gonorrhoea ranged between 0% in men in Kisumu and 2.7% in women in Yaoundé. Men and women in Yaoundé had the highest prevalence of chlamydial infection (5.9 and 9.4%, respectively). In the other cities, the prevalence of chlamydial infection ranged between 1.3% in women in Cotonou and 4.5% in women in Kisumu. In Ndola, the prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity was over 10% in both men and women; it was around 6% in Yaoundé, 3-4% in Kisumu, and 1-2% in Cotonou. Chlamydial infection was associated with rate of partner change for both men and women, and with young age for women. At the population level, the prevalence of chlamydial infection correlated well with reported rates of partner change. Positive syphilis serology was associated with rate of partner change and with HSV-2 infection. The latter association could be due to biological interaction between syphilis and HSV-2 or to residual confounding by sexual behaviour. At the population level, there was no correlation between prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity and reported rates of partner change. Conclusion: Differences in prevalence of chlamydial infection could be explained by differences in reported sexual behaviour, but the variations in prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity remained unexplained.

Alcohol use and HIV risk factors: Results from the 2011 Uganda AIDS indicator survey,Aluzimbi G.,"Background: Uganda has one of the highest per capita alcohol consumption worldwide. Alcohol use has been shown to increase the likelihood of high risk sexual behavior and is associated with HIV infection. We evaluated the association between alcohol use during sex and HIV prevalence in a nationally representative household survey in Uganda. Methods: The Uganda AIDS Indicator Survey was a population-based household survey designed to produce national and regional estimates of HIV prevalence and risk behavior, conducted February to September 2011. HIV and syphilis serological tests were conducted on all consenting participants. Respondents who were sexually active in the past 12 months were asked if alcohol was consumed by both, either or none of them during sex with most recent sexual partner. We analyzed data from respondents aged 15-59 who had had sex in the past 12 months and had reported consumption of alcohol during sexual intercourse. Results: A total of 21741 persons were enrolled in the Uganda AIS; 15917 (85.1%) reported being sexually active in the 12 months prior to the survey; and alcohol consumption during most recent sexual activity was reported by 24.0% of men (1719/7133) and 24.1% of women (2123/8775). Condom use at last sexual intercourse was higher among nondrinkers compared to alcohol drinkers (men: 2.6% vs. women: 5.8%). Overall, HIV prevalence was higher in those who consumed alcohol during sex compared to those who did not (men: 10.4% vs. 5.9%; women: 9.5% vs. 7.7%). In adjusted analysis, alcohol use during sex was associated with HIV infection (men: OR= 1.7 [95% CI 1.29-2.15], women: OR=1.3 [CI 1.03-1.59]), syphilis infection (men: OR= 1.7 [95% CI 1.14-2.62], women: OR=1.8 [CI 1.24-2.53]), unprotected sex (men OR=1.7 [CI 1.49-1.98], women OR=1.9 [CI 95% 1.54-2.48]), and paying for sex among men (OR=1.8 [CI 1.42-2.18]). Men who were circumcised (OR=0.5 [CI 0.32-0.78]) were less likely to drink alcohol prior to sexual intercourse. Conclusions: About 25% of Ugandans consumed alcohol during sex. Alcohol consumption was associated with lower condom use, and higher HIV and syphilis infection. Alcohol interventions should be closely integrated into HIV prevention policy and programming.",2015,,Topics in Antiviral Medicine,23,"(Aluzimbi G.)

Sexual behavior of HIV discordant couples after HIV counseling and testing.,Allen S.; Meinzen-Derr J.; Kautzman M.; Zulu I.; Trask S.; Fideli U.; Musonda R.; Kasolo F.; Gao F.; Haworth A.,"Sexual behavior following voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT) is described in 963 cohabiting heterosexual couples with one HIV positive and one HIV negative partner ('discordant couples'). Biological markers were used to assess the validity of self-report. Couples were recruited from a same-day VCT center in Lusaka, Zambia. Sexual exposures with and without condoms were recorded at 3-monthly intervals. Sperm detected on vaginal smears, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) including HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, and Trichomonas vaginalis were assessed. Less than 3% of couples reported current condom use prior to VCT. In the year after VCT, > 80% of reported acts of intercourse in discordant couples included condom use. Reporting 100% condom use was associated with 39-70% reductions in biological markers; however most intervals with reported unprotected sex were negative for all biological markers. Under-reporting was common: 50% of sperm and 32% of pregnancies and HIV transmissions were detected when couples had reported always using condoms. Positive laboratory tests for STD and reported extramarital sex were relatively infrequent. DNA sequencing confirmed that 87% of new HIV infections were acquired from the spouse. Joint VCT prompted sustained but imperfect condom use in HIV discordant couples. Biological markers were insensitive but provided evidence for a significant under-reporting of unprotected sex. Strategies that encourage truthful reporting of sexual behavior and sensitive biological markers of exposure are urgently needed.

Incidence of curable sexually transmitted infections among South African women recently infected with HIV,Balkus J.E.; Husnik M.E.; Palanee-Phillips T.; Panchia R.; Harkoo I.; Pather A.; Govender V.; Taljaard M.; Gorbach P.; Riddler S.,"Background: Curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia (CT), gonorrhea (GC), and trichomoniasis (TV) are common among HIV-infected women; however, data are limited for women recently infected with HIV. We assessed the incidence of and risk factors for CT, GC and TV among South African women who acquired HIV while participating in VOICE, a phase IIB randomized trial of daily oral and vaginal chemoprophylaxis for HIV prevention in Ugandan, South African, and Zimbabwean women. Methods: Women who acquired HIV during VOICE were invited to enroll in MTN-015, a multi-site, prospective cohort study of women who became HIV-infected in Microbicide Trials Network studies. Demographic and sexual behavior data were collected via face-to-face interviews. Participants were tested for STIs (CT/GC using nucleic acid amplification tests and TV using rapid tests) at enrollment, annual visits and when clinically indicated. Treatment was provided according to WHO guidelines. Cox proportional hazards models stratified by site were used to assess baseline correlates of CT, GC or TV infection during follow-up, each as separate outcomes. Multivariable models were adjusted for age and other factors that were associated with STI acquisition in univariate models (p≤0.1). Results: Of 339 eligible South African women from VOICE, 237 enrolled in MTN-015 and 207 had CT, GC, or TV results at enrollment and during follow-up. Median time from testing HIV+ in VOICE to MTN-015 enrollment was 2.3 months (interquartile range 1.3-3.8). Detection of CT while participating in VOICE was associated with incident CT in MTN-015 (yes=27.1/100 person-years [p-yrs] vs no=6.9/100 p-yrs; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.7, 95% CI 1.5, 9.3) and younger age trended toward an association (age <25 years=14.6/100 p-yrs vs. ≥25 years=7.6/100 p-yrs; aHR 2.0, 95% CI 0.8, 4.9). Having any curable STI in VOICE (CT, GC, or TV) was associated with incident TV (yes=16.5/100 p-yrs vs. no=4.2/100 p-yrs; aHR 5.6 95% CI 1.7, 18.4). No factors were associated with GC during follow-up. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses that excluded participants with the STI of interest at enrollment from each analysis. Prevalence and incidence of curable STIs among HIV-infected South African women Conclusions: Curable STI incidence was high among South African women recently infected with HIV, especially among women who had a recent STI. New strategies for STI prevention counseling, screening, and treatment of women and their partners are needed to reduce the burden of curable STIs among recently HIV-infected women in this region.

School based HIV prevention in Zimbabwe: feasibility and acceptability of evaluation trials using biological outcomes.,Cowan FM.; Langhaug LF.; Mashungupa GP.; Nyamurera T.; Hargrove J.; Jaffar S.; Peeling RW.; Brown DW.; Power R.; Johnson AM.; Stephenson JM.; Bassett MT.; Hayes RJ.;  .,"To determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a community randomized trial (CRT) of an adolescent reproductive health intervention (ARHI) using biological measures of effectiveness. Four secondary schools and surrounding communities in rural Zimbabwe. Discussions were held with pupils, parents, teachers and community leaders to determine acceptability. A questionnaire and urine sampling survey was undertaken among Form 1 and 2 pupils. Studies were undertaken to inform likely participation and follow up in a future CRT. A community survey of 16-19-year-olds was conducted to determine levels of secondary school attendance and likely HIV prevalence at final follow up in the event of a trial. Form 1 and 2 pupils aged 12-18 years (n = 723; median age, 15 years) participated in the research. Prevalences of HIV, Chlamydia and gonorrhoea were 3.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-5.3%], 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1-1.3%) and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.0-3.3%) respectively. There was poor correlation between biological evidence of sexual experience and questionnaire responses, due to concerns about confidentiality. Only 13% (95% CI, 4-27%) of those infected with HIV and/or a sexually transmitted disease admitted to having had sex. In the community survey of 573 adolescents aged 16-19 years, 6.6% (95% CI, 3.9-10.3%) of females and 5.1% (95% CI, 2.9-8.2%) of males were HIV positive.

Our aim was to determine the efficacy of HIV-1 voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) in reducing unprotected intercourse among individuals and sex-partner couples in Nairobi (Kenya), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), and Port of Spain (Trinidad). Methods. Individual or couple participants were randomly assigned HIV-1 VCT or basic health information. At first follow-up (mean 7.3 months after baseline) health-information participants were offered VCT and all VCT participants were offered retesting. Sexually transmitted infections were diagnosed and treated at first follow-up. The second follow-up (mean 13.9 months after baseline) involved only behavioural assessment, and all participants were again offered VCT. Findings. 3120 individuals and 586 couples were enrolled. The proportion of individuals reporting unprotected intercourse with non-primary partners declined significantly more for those receiving VCT than those receiving health information (men, 35% reduction with VCT vs 13% reduction with health information; women, 39% reduction with VCT vs 17% reduction with health information), and these results were maintained at the second follow-up. Individual HIV-1-infected men were more likely than uninfected men to reduce unprotected intercourse with primary and non-primary partners, whereas HIV-1-infected women were more likely than uninfected women to reduce unprotected intercourse with primary partners. Couples assigned VCT reduced unprotected intercourse with their enrolment partners significantly more than couples assigned health information, but no differences were found in unprotected intercourse with non-enrolment partners. Couples in which one or both members were diagnosed with HIV-1 were more likely to reduce unprotected intercourse with each other than couples in which both members were uninfected. These changes were replicated by those in the health-information group diagnosed with HIV-1 at first follow-up. Interpretation.

"Spatial analysis of factors associated with HIV infection among young people in Uganda, 2011.",Chimoyi LA.; Musenge E.,"The HIV epidemic in East Africa is of public health importance with an increasing number of young people getting infected. This study sought to identify spatial clusters and examine the geographical variation of HIV infection at a regional level while accounting for risk factors associated with HIV/AIDS among young people in Uganda. A secondary data analysis was conducted on a survey cross-sectional design whose data were obtained from the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and AIDS Indicator Survey (AIS) for 7 518 young people aged 15-24 years. The analysis was performed in three stages while incorporating population survey sampling weights. Maximum likelihood-based logistic regression models were used to explore the non-spatially adjusted factors associated with HIV infection. Spatial scan statistic was used to identify geographical clusters of elevated HIV infections which justified modelling using a spatial random effects model by Bayesian-based logistic regression models. In this study, 309/533 HIV sero-positive female participants were selected with majority residing in the rural areas [386(72%)]. Compared to singles, those currently [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =3.64; (95% CI; 1.25-10.27)] and previously married [AOR = 5.62; (95% CI: 1.52-20.75)] participants had significantly higher likelihood of HIV infections. Sexually Transmitted Infections [AOR = 2.21; (95% CI: 1.35-3.60)] were more than twice likely associated with HIV infection. One significant (p < 0.05) primary cluster of HIV prevalence around central Uganda emerged from the SaTScan cluster analysis. Spatial analysis disclosed behavioural factors associated with greater odds of HIV infection such as; alcohol use before sexual intercourse [Posterior Odds Ratio (POR) =1.32; 95% (BCI: 1.11-1.63)]. Condom use [POR = 0.54; (95% BCI: 0.41-0.69)] and circumcision [POR = 0.66; (95% BCI: 0.45-0.99)] provided a protective effect against HIV. The study revealed associations between high-risk sexual behaviour and HIV infection. Behavioural change interventions should therefore be pertinent to the prevention of HIV. Spatial analysis further revealed a significant HIV cluster towards the Central and Eastern areas of Uganda.

Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among women attending antenatal clinics in northeastern Tanzania,Chiduo M.,"Introduction Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and reproductive tract infections (STI/RTIs) among pregnant women is important to minimize peripartum and perinatal morbidity. In Tanzania all the pregnant women attending antenatal clinics (ANC) are screened with serological tests for HIV and syphilis. However, screening for other STIs is not routinely done. This study determined the prevalences of syphilis, Trichomonas vaginalis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia and Candida infection among pregnant women in Tanga, Tanzania. Methods Pregnant women enrolled in a randomised, prevention of-mother-to-child transmission trial (n = 105) and HIVuninfected pregnant women (n = 100) attending antenatal clinics from three health facilities were enrolled between April 2009 and August 2010. The women were interviewed, examined and genital and blood samples were collected for Neisseria gonorrhea, Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, Treponema pallidum and chlamydia. Results Genital infections were more prevalent in HIV-infected women than HIV-uninfected women, statistically significant for trichomoniasis (18.8% vs. 5.0%; P < 0.003) and candidiasis (16.5% vs. 2.0%; P < 0.001) no significant differences were found for the prevalence of chlamydia infection (0% vs. 3.0%; P = 0.15), syphilis (2.4% vs. 3.0%; P = 0.57/), and gonorrhea (3.5% vs. 0%; P = 0.095). Though it was offered, none of the partners of the women with transmittable STIs reported for testing and treatment. Conclusion STIs/RTIs were common in both HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women. Screening of every pregnant woman attending antenatal clinics should include microbiological investigations besides the rapid tests for syphilis and HIV.

"Influence of infant-feeding patterns on early mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in Durban, South Africa: A prospective cohort study",Coutsoudis A.; Pillay K.; Spooner E.; Kuhn L.; Coovadia H.M.,"Background. The observation that mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 can occur through breastfeeding has resulted in policies that recommend avoidance of breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women in the developed world and under specific circumstances in developing countries. We compared transmission rates in exclusively breastfed, mixed-fed, and formula-fed (never breastfed) infants to assess whether the pattern of breastfeeding is a critical determinant of early mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. Methods. We prospectively assessed infant-feeding practices of 549 HIV-1-infected women who were part of a vitamin A intervention trial in Durban, South Africa. The proportions of HIV-1-infected infants at 3 months (estimated by use of Kaplan-Meier life tables) were compared in the three different feeding groups. HIV-1 infection was defined by a positive RNA-PCR test. Findings. At 3 months, 18.8% (95% CI 12.6-24.9) of 156 never-breastfed children were estimated to be HIV-1 infected compared with 21.3% (17.2-25.5) of 393 breastfed children (p = 0.5). The estimated proportion (Kaplan-Meier) of infants HIV-1 infected by 3 months was significantly lower for those exclusively breastfed to 3 months than in those who received mixed feeding before 3 months (14.6% [7.7-21.4] vs 24.1% [19.0-29.2], p = 0.03]. After adjustment for potential confounders (maternal CD4-cell/CD8-cell ratio, syphilis screening test results, and preterm delivery), exclusive breastfeeding carried a significantly lower risk of HIV-1 transmission than mixed feeding (hazard ratio 0.52 [0.28-0.98]) and a similar risk to no breastfeeding (0.85 [0.51-1.42]). Interpretations. Our findings have important implications for prevention of HIV-1 infection and infant-feeding policies in developing countries and further research is essential. In the meantime, breastfeeding policies for HIV-1-infected women require urgent review. If our findings are confirmed, exclusive breastfeeding may offer HIV-1-infected women in developing countries an affordable, culturally acceptable, and effective means of reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 while maintaining the overwhelming benefits of breastfeeding.",1999,,Lancet,354,9177,471-476,,10.1016/S0140-6736(99)01101-0,,#2331,Coutsoudis 1999,Exclusion reason: 4.

Design: Analysis of a randomized trial of STD control for HIV prevention, Rakai, Uganda. Methods: Consenting adults 15-59 years of age were seen at 10-monthly home visits, interviewed regarding STD symptoms, and asked to provide samples for HIV and STD diagnoses. HIV incidence was determined in 8089 HIV-negative subjects over 10,457 person years. Adjusted rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of HIV acquisition associated with genital ulcer disease (GUD) and discharge/dysuria were used to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of HIV acquisition. HIV transmission risks associated with STD symptoms in HIV-positive partners of 167 HIV discordant couples and the numbers of sexual partners reported by HIV-positive subjects were used to estimate the PAF of HIV transmission attributable to STD. Results: HIV prevalence was 16%. The risk of HIV acquisition was increased with GUD (RR 3.14; CI 1.98-4.98) and in males with discharge/dysuria (RR 2.44; CI 1.17-5.12), but not in females with discharge/dysuria. The PAF of HIV acquisition was 9.5% (CI 2.8-15.8%) with any of the three STD symptoms. The PAF for GUD was 8.8% (CI 3.7-13.8), but only 8.2% of reported GUD was caused by treatable syphilis or chancroid. The PAF for discharge/dysuria in males was 6.7% (CI 1.1-13.8), but only 25% of symptomatic males had concurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection. No significant differences were seen in PAF between study treatment arms. The PAF of HIV transmission associated with STD symptoms in HIV-positive persons was indirectly estimated to be 10.4%. Conclusion: In this mature, generalized HIV epidemic setting, most HIV seroconversion occurs without recognized STD symptoms or curable STD detected by screening. Therefore, syndromic management or other strategies of STD treatment are unlikely to substantially reduce HIV incidence in this population. However, STD is associated with significant HIV risk at the individual level, and STD management is needed to protect individuals.",1999,,AIDS,13,15,2113-2123,,10.1097/00002030-199910220-00015,,#2346,Gray 1999,Exclusion reason: 3.

"Burden of genital discharge pathogens and associated characteristics of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients in Johannesburg, South Africa",Lewis D.; Chirwa T.; Msimang V.; Radebe F.; Kamb M.; Sanne I.; Firnhaber C.,"Background: The prevalence of asymptomatic STIs and urethritis/ cervicitis pathogen-associated patient characteristics were determined among patients attending a HIV treatment centre in Johannesburg. Methods: Consenting consecutive HIV-infected patients, asymptomatic for symptoms/signs of genital discharge, were screened over 12 months for gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, chlamydial and Mycoplasma genitalium infections using a real-time PCR assay. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Candida were detected by microscopy (women only). Serological assays diagnosed syphilis (RPR/TPPA) and herpes simplex type 2 (IgG ELISA) infections. Patients returned at 2 weeks; those with positive results were treated and given contact slips for partners. If available, patients' most recent CD4 (83%) and viral load (VL) (60%) results were recorded. Demographic, clinical and behavioural data were collected by nurse-administered questionnaire. A descriptive analysis was conducted to obtain frequency distributions of patient and STI prevalence data. Associations were investigated using the χ2 test at a 5% level of significance. A multiple logistic regression model was fitted to find factors associated with urethritis/cervicitis pathogens. Results: 1109 patients were enrolled (551 men, 558 women). Compared with men, women were younger with a mean age [SD] of 35.0 [7.3] vs 37.9 [7.9] years (p<0.001), reported more STIs in the past year (65.5% vs 56.5%, p=0.002), were less likely to know their partner's HIV status (53.1% vs 62.3%, p=0.007), were more likely to be on HAART (70.4% vs 59.7%, p<0.001) with an undetectable VL (81.0% vs 69.9%, p<0.001) and a higher mean [SD] CD4 count of 346 [203] vs 232 [173] cells/mm3 (p<0.001). Urethritis/cervicitis pathogens were detected in 119/558 (21.3%) women and 90/550 (16.4%) men (p=0.035). BV and Candida were detected in 155 (28.0%) and 101 (18.3%) women, respectively. Detection of urethritis/cervicitis pathogens was associated with recent sexual intercourse with a regular partner (adjusted OR, aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.08% to 2.48%). Trichomoniasis was associated with female gender (aOR 2.45, 95% CI 1.39% to 4.32%) and sub-optimal condom use with regular partners (aOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.23% to 3.41%).

Methods: In Cotonou, two studies employing similar methods were carried out in 1998 and 2008 respectively. In these studies, the census areas (clusters) were sampled with probability proportional to size. After enumeration of all households in the selected clusters, a certain number of households were randomly sampled from each selected census area (950 in 1998, 1070 in 2008). Consenting adults, aged 15-49 years (but 15-64 years for the men in 2008) were interviewed and screened for HIV, syphilis, and HSV-2 (serologic detection of antibodies for the latter infections), Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis (nucleic acid amplification assays on urogenital samples). The Roa-Scott χ2 was used to consider the cluster effect in the univariate comparison of proportions. Logistic regression (taking into account the cluster effect) was used for multivariate analysis, adjusting for socio-demographic variables. Results: The global HIV prevalence was stable (3.4% in 1998 vs 3.1% in 2008). There was however a trend towards decreasing among men (Abstract O1-S09.05 table 1). The decrease was highly significant among men aged less than 30 (3.0% in 1998 vs 0.5% in 2008, p<0.0001). A trend towards decreasing prevalence was also observed among women aged less than 20 (2.4% in 1998 vs 0.5% in 2008, p=0.102). On the other hand, an upward trend was observed among women aged 20+ (3.8 in 1998 vs 4.8% in 2008, p=0.346). Syphilis prevalence also decreased significantly, but this decline was more pronounced among women (Abstract O1-S09.05 table 1). The prevalence of gonorrhoea trended lower among men while prevalence of HSV-2 increased among both men and women (Abstract O1-S09.05 table 1). The proportion of adults who reported condom use during their last extramarital sexual intercourse increased (23.0% in 1998 vs 40.1% in 2008, p<0.0001). Discussion The decrease in HIV prevalence among young people could be explained by the increase in condom use and may also be related to the impact of intensive interventions targeting the prostitution milieu during the same period. The upward trend among older women could be related to a large increase in access to antiretroviral therapy that occurred from 2004 onwards.

Condom use and its association with HIV/sexually transmitted diseases in four urban communities of sub-Saharan Africa,Lagarde E.; Auvert B.; Chege J.; Sukwa T.; Glynn J.R.; Weiss H.A.; Akam E.; Laourou M.; Caraël M.; Buvé A.,"Objectives: To estimate rates of condom use in four urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa and to assess their association with levels of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Methods: Data were obtained from a multicentre study of factors that determine the differences in rate of spread of HIV in four African cities. Consenting participants were interviewed on sexual behaviour, and also provided blood and urine samples for testing for HIV infection and other STDs. Data on sexual behaviour included information on condom use during all reported spousal and non-spousal partnerships in the past 12 months. Results: A total of 2116 adults aged 15-49 years were interviewed in Cotonou (Benin), 2089 in Yaoundé (Cameroon), 1889 in Kisumu (Kenya) and 1730 in Ndola (Zambia). Prevalence rates of HIV infection were 3.4% in Cotonou, 5.9% in Yaoundé, 25.9% in Kisumu and 28.4% in Ndola. Reported condom use was low, with the proportions of men and women who reported frequent condom use with all non-spousal partners being 21-25% for men and 11-24% for women. A higher level of condom use by city was not associated with lower aggregate level of HIV infection. The proportions of men reporting genital pain or discharge during the past 12 months were significantly lower among those reporting frequent condom use in all sites except Yaoundé: in Cotonou, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 0.09-0.94; in Kisumu, adjusted OR = 0.34, 95% Cl = 0.14-0.83; and in Ndola, adjusted OR = 0.33, 95% Cl = 0.12-0.90. The same association was found for reported genital ulcers in two sites only: in Cotonou, adjusted OR = 0.14, 95% Cl = 0.02-1.02; and in Kisumu, adjusted OR = 0.18, 95% Cl = 0.04-0.75. There were few statistically significant associations between condom use and biological indicators of HIV infection or other STDs in any of the cities. Conclusion: Similar levels of condom use were found in all four populations, and aggregate levels of condom use by city could not discriminate between cities with high and low level of HIV infection. It seems that rates of condom use may not have been high enough to have a strong impact on HIV/STD levels in the four cities. At an individual level, only a male history of reported STD symptoms was found to be consistently associated with lower rates of reported condom use. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2001,,AIDS,15,SUPPL. 4,S71-S78,,10.1097/00002030-200108004-00008,,#2116,Lagarde 2001,Exclusion reason: 4.

Association between genital schistosomiasis and HIV in rural Zimbabwean women,"Kjetland, E. F.; Ndhlovu, P. D.; Gomo, E.; Mduluza, T.; Midzi, N.; Gwanzura, L.; Mason, P. R.; Sandvik, L.; Friis, H.; Gundersen, S. G.","Objective: To determine the association between female genital Schistosoma haematobium infection and HIV. Design and methods: A cross-sectional study with a 1-year follow-up. Gynecological and laboratory investigations were performed for S. haematobium and HIV. Sexually transmitted infections, demographic and urogenital history were analysed as confounders. The participants were 527 sexually active, non-pregnant, non-menopausal women between the ages of 20 and 49 years. The setting was a rural Zimbabwean community where S. haematobium related lesions were found in 46% of the women, HIV in 29% and herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) in 65%. Results: In permanent residents (>3 years residency), HIV was found in 41% (29/70) of women with laboratory proven genital schistosomiasis as opposed to 26% HIV positive (96/375) in the schistosomal ova negative group [odds ratio (OR), 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.5; P = 0.008. In multivariate analysis S. haematobium infection of the genital mucosa was significantly associated with HIV seropositivity (adjusted OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.11-7.5; P = 0.030). All seven women who became HIV positive during the study period (seroincidence 3.1%) had signs of S. haematobium at baseline. In accordance with other studies HIV was significantly associated with HSV-2 (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.7-5.3; P < 0.001), syphilis and human papillomavirus. The highest HIV prevalence (45%) was found in the 25-29 years age group. Conclusion: Women with genital schistosomiasis had an almost three-fold risk of having HIV in this rural Zimbabwean community.

High prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among adolescent girls attending secondary school in Tanzania,Francis S.C.; Hansen C.; Irani J.; Andreasen A.; Jespers V.; Nnko S.; Crucitti T.; Changalucha C.; Watson-Jones D.; Buve A.,"Introduction Prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) are particularly high among adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa. One area in need of further research is the role played by the vaginal microbiota in the susceptibility to HIV and other STI in adolescent girls. The aim of this study was to characterise the vaginal microbiota of adolescent girls in Tanzania around the time of their sexual debut. Methods Girls attending secondary schools in Mwanza City, ages 17 and 18 years old, were invited to join a cross-sectional study. After informed consent/assent, girls were interviewed and nurseassisted, self-collected swabs were obtained for STI and BV testing. BV was considered as a binary outcome: Nugent scores 7- 10 were considered BV positive. Factors associated with prevalent BV were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Results Of the 403 girls who enrolled in the study, 176 (44%) reported having had sexual intercourse and 8 (2%) reported receiving cunnilungus. Ninety-five (25%) girls had BV, 9 (2%) were infected with Chlamydia trachomatis, 8 (2%) had Neisseria gonorrhoea, 18 (5%) had Trichomonas vaginalis, 85 (21%) had Human papilloma virus and 6 (2%) Mycoplasma genitalium. Six (2%) girls were infected with HSV-2. Among girls who were sexually naïve, 19% had BV compared to 32% in sexually active girls. BV was independently associated with sexual debut (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.32,3.39); oral sex (aOR = 7.94; 95% 1.53,40.3); >1 sex partner (aOR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.21,5.39); and HPV (aOR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.02,2.94). Conclusion In this study among girls attending secondary school in Mwanza, Tanzania, sexual debut was associated with BV; however, 19% of girls who were sexually naïve had BV. This suggests that sexual intercourse may not be a prerequisite for BV. Oral sex was also associated with BV although the reported prevalence of this sexual behaviour was low.",2015,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,91,"(Nnko S.; Changalucha C.)

"Pattern of sexually transmitted infections (STIS) in hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine devices (IUD) users attending family planning clinics in Ibadan, Nigeria",Fayemiwo S.A.; Fatiregun A.A.; Bakare R.A.,"The large majority of women who acquire HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are in their childbearing years and are current or potential users of contraceptive methods. Using contraceptives has two main benefits; the primary benefit of preventing unplanned pregnancy and the potential secondary benefit of protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Unfortunately, the contraceptive with the best records for pregnancy prevention offers little if, any protection against STIs. The study aimed at assessing the pattern of sexually transmitted infections among hormonal contraceptives and intra-uterine contraceptive devices users attending family planning clinic, University College Hospital Ibadan. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in a population of women using Intra-Uterine Contraceptive Devices (IUCD) and hormonal contraceptive methods attending Family Planning clinics at University College Hospital, Ibadan. Detailed medical history, Endocervical and high vaginal swabs were collected from the participants to establish diagnosis after clinical examination and informed consent. Results: There were 200 participants with a mean age of 31.92 years (SD=8.33, range=16-55). Themean age of sexual debut of participants with any STI was 19.5 years. 102 (51.0%) of the women were using different methods of hormonal contraceptives while 84 (42.0 %) had intrauterine contraceptives devices inserted. About 54.5 % (109) had various STIs in both groups. The most common STI diagnosed was bacterial vaginosis (26.5%). Other STIs diagnosed were vaginal candidiasis (26.0 %), HIV (8.5%), trichomoniasis (7.5%), Chlamydia cervicitis (7.0%), syphilis (3.5%), Genital warts (3.5 %) and gonorrhoea (2.5 %). Even though bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis were diagnosed more in women with IUCD while Chlamydia cervicitis, syphilis and gonorrhoea occurred more in women using various types of hormonal contraceptives, there was no statistical relationship between the STIs and their sexual behaviours. Conclusion Women seeking contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy are as much in need of education about prevention of STIs as much as the counselling regarding the most effective contraceptive methods.

Methods Women aged 18-44 years, working in recreational facilities were screened and if eligible recruited. Eligible women were enrolled and followed up quarterly for 1 year. At each visit, participants were interviewed to obtain information about potential HIV risk factors, sexual behaviours and factors associated with lost to follow-up. Samples were collected and tested to measure the burden of STIs and other genital infections and pregnancy rates. We analysed data collected at enrolment and during the follow-up period to determine independent risk factors for STIs, pregnancy and trend of changes in risky sexual behaviours. Results Majority of participants were aged 20-19 years (57%), with primary education (87%), widowed, separated or divorced (49%). HIV prevalence at screening was 22% and associated with age, education, marital status and type of job. HIV incidence was 4.1/100 person years. Overall prevalence of other STIs was also very high. Overall pregnancy incidence was high 30.3/100 person years and was associated with age, use of contraceptives and number of previous pregnancies. Many women reported multiple sexual partners (32%) and rarely using condoms, although 99% knew about condoms.

Periodic presumptive treatment for vaginal infections may reduce chlamydia and gonorrhoea incidence: A secondary analysis from the preventing vaginal infections trial,Balkus J.E.; Anzala O.; Kimani J.; Schwebke J.; Lee J.; Kabare E.; McClelland R.S.,"Background Women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) are at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STI), including Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC). Among women participating in a randomised trial of periodic presumptive treatment to reduce vaginal infections, we assessed the intervention effect on incident CT and GC infections. Methods Non pregnant, HIV-uninfected women aged 18-45 from the US and Kenya were randomised to receive intravaginal metronidazole 750 mg plus miconazole 200 mg or matching placebo for 5 consecutive nights each month for 12 months. Genital specimens were collected every other month. Baseline specimens were tested for CT/GC during the trial and follow-up specimens were tested after trial completion using the Aptima Combo-2 assay. Baseline STIs were treated according to local guidelines. Poisson regression models were used to assess the intervention effect on the outcomes separately and as a combined endpoint. Results Of 234 women enrolled, 221 (94%) had specimens available for analysis (intervention n = 110; placebo n = 111). Baseline CT and GC prevalence was 7% (n = 16) and 1% (n = 3), respectively, and similar by arm. Among 205 CT- participants, there were 21 incident CT infections during 179.6 person- years (CT incidence = 11.7/100 person-years), with lower CT incidence in the intervention arm versus placebo (7.8/100 person-years versus 15.6/100 person-years; incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.50, 95% CI 0.20-1.23). Among 218 GC- participants, GC incidence was 7.2/100 person-years (14 infections during 93.3 person-years) and also lower in the intervention arm (5.2/100 person-years versus 9.3/100 person-years; IRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.19-1.67). Results were consistent when CT/GC was assessed as combined endpoint (IRR = 0.57; 95% CI 0.27- 1.19). Conclusions This intervention, which significantly reduced BV over 12 months, may also reduce women's STI acquisition risk. The small sample size in this secondary analysis precluded detection of significant associations, but generated point estimates for reductions in STIs that could inform the planning of future STI prevention trials.",2015,,Sexually Transmitted Infections,91,"(Lee J.)

Infectious and noninfectious multimorbidity among HIV clinic clients in the African cohort study,Ake J.; Maswai J.; Kiweewa F.; Maganga L.; Omondi M.; Keshinro B.; Hughes L.; Valcour V.G.; Polyak C.,"Background: The frequency and complexity of multimorbidity in the increasingly treated African HIV epidemic is not comprehensively described. Methods: The African Cohort Study (AFRICOS) prospectively enrolls adult HIV clinic clients and uninfected adults at 10 PEPFAR supported facilities in Kayunga, Uganda; South Rift Valley and Kisumu West, Kenya; Mbeya, Tanzania and Abuja, Nigeria. We evaluated infectious comorbidities (ICOs) at baseline: HBV, HCV and syphilis by screening serologies, pulmonary TB by Xpert MTB/RIF, and cryptococcosis by serum CrAg if CD4≤200. Baseline noninfectious comorbidities (NICOs) included elevated blood pressure (SBP>138 or DBP>79), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (>99 mg/dl), renal insufficiency (GFR<60 mL/min), hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >199 mg/dl), anemia (hemoglobin <11 mg/ dl), and cognitive impairment (International HIV Dementia Scale < 1.5 SD below the mean). We compared those with no comorbidities to those with ≥2 comorbidities using descriptive statistics and investigated determinants of NICOs employing multivariate Poisson regression. Results: From January 2013 to August 2014, 899 HIV infected adults enrolled in Kayunga (22%), South Rift Valley (41%), Kisumu West (15%), Mbeya (14%), and Abuja (7%). Participants were 60% female with mean age 40.5 years and mean CD4 count 419 cells/mm3. Among the 73% taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), mean ART duration was 4.1 years, 68% were suppressed to < 50 copies/mL, and 78% had exposure to thymidine analogues. Rates of smoking and IDU were low (3.4% and 0.2%). Reactive serologies for hepatitis B, C, and syphilis were identified in 5.2%, 4.4% and 1.3%. Sixteen (1.8%) had positive Xpert assays and 2 (0.7%) had cryptococcal antigenemia. The most common NICOs were elevated blood pressure (17.7%), anemia (13.1%) and IFG (11.4%). 48% had at least one comorbidity and 14% had ≥2. 12% had ≥1 ICO and 41% had ≥1 NICO. Those with ≥2 comorbidities had significantly higher age (p<0.0001), lower CD4 count (p=0.004) and higher body mass index (BMI) (p=0.01) than those without comorbidity. Multivariate regression revealed independent association of age (p<0.0001), BMI (p=0.02), CD4 count (p=0.03) and female gender (p=0.02) with total NICOs. Conclusions: The cohort demonstrates considerable HIV associated multimorbidity in a largely rural African context. Body mass and CD4 count are potentially modifiable predictors of NICOs.

"Bacterial vaginosis in women of reproductive age in Osun State, south western Nigeria",Adetunji M.A.,"Introduction Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of abnormal discharge in women of reproductive age. It is considered to be a major cause of significant reproductive morbidity and is increasingly associated with enhancing the transmission of HIV. It is therefore imperative to determine the occurrence of bacterial vaginosis among women of reproductive age. Methods High vaginal swabs were collected from 200 consenting patients aged 18-45 years and tested for bacterial vaginosis. The swabs were mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) on a slide. Absence or presence of fishy odour was noted. A wet mount was prepared and viewed to look for clue cells and motile trichomonals and yeast. The presence of clue cells on wet microscopy, a positive amine test, abnormal vaginal discharge and pH above 4.5 indicated bacterial vaginosis. Diagnosis of trichomoniasis was based on the presence of motile Trichomonas in wet mount microscopy of the discharge. Results An overall prevalence rate of 78% for BV was recorded; other infections observed among women included candidiasis 15%, trichomoniasis 2% and mixed infections BV and yeast 5%. Conclusion Bacterial vaginosis remains an important reproductive health problem. There is need for health education among women of the reproductive age group.

Signs and symptoms as indicators of female genital schistosomiasis,Lillebø K.; Kleppa E.; Pillay P.; Holmen S.; Mtshali A.; Taylor M.; Kjetland E.F.,"Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) is a neglected, poverty-related disease. Several studies also indicate higher prevalence of HIV in women with FGS. The co-existence of FGS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) pose a diagnostic challenge for health care providers. The syndromatic management of STIs are strategies in disease prevention in developing countries. In spite of its public health implications, FGS has never been included in any of these protocols. It is therefore important to explore how self-reported symptoms, signs and behavior can be used as indicators of FGS. A school based, cluster randomized, crosssectional study was conducted in a Schistosoma haematobium endemic area in rural South Africa. A total of 921 young women aged 16-22 were included. They were interviewed and asked about symptoms and behavior and gynecological examination with colposcopy was done. Samples (urine, blood and vaginal lavage) for laboratory analyses for STIs and S. haematobium were collected. Girls infected with schistosomiasis (cases) were compared with girls without schistosomiasis (controls). Multivariate regression was used for the statistical analyses. Female genital schistosomiasis may be a differential diagnosis to STIs in schistosomiasis endemic areas. It is of importance that health care workers consider this when adequate laboratory facilities are lacking. Symptoms could be added into an algorithm for a syndromatic approach to diagnosis, the meager effect of treatment and reinfection in this age group will be discussed.",2012,,American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,87,5,386-387,,,,#3599,Lillebø 2012,Exclusion reason: 6.

"Predictors of perceived male partner concurrency among women at risk for HIV and STI acquisition in Durban, South Africa.",Gaffoor Z.; Wand H.; Street RA.; Abbai N.; Ramjee G.,"Women in sub-Saharan Africa continue to be at greater risk for HIV acquisition than men. Concurrency, viz. multiple sexual partnerships that overlap over time, has been studied as a possible risk factor for HIV transmission. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of perceived male partner concurrency among sexually active, HIV negative women. Socio-demographic and behavioural data from women enrolled in a biomedical HIV prevention clinical trial were assessed in relation to perceived male partner concurrency using the Chi squared test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the independent predictors of perceived male partner concurrency. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were obtained for HIV and STI incidence in relation to male partner concurrency. A Cox Proportional Hazards model was used to assess the association between perceived male partner concurrency and HIV and STI incidence. The results revealed that 29 % of women reported their male partners to be in concurrent sexual relationships, 22 % reported partners that were not engaging in concurrency, whilst 49 % reported not knowing their partners concurrency status. Older women, having never married, experiencing economic abuse, and women reporting individual concurrency, were found to be significant predictors of perceived male partner concurrency in the studied population. Perceived male partner concurrency was not found to be a significantly associated with incident HIV and STI infections in this analysis. The study provides insight into predictors of perceived male partner concurrency among women at high risk for STI and HIV acquisition. These results may inform the design of behavioural and biomedical interventions, to address the role of multiple sexual partnerships in HIV prevention.",2016,,AIDS research and therapy,13,,14,,10.1186/s12981-016-0098-7,26958071,#1485,Gaffoor 2016,Exclusion reason: HIV incidence study; ,""
Sexually transmitted disease and HIV prevalence and risk factors in concentrated and generalized HIV epidemic settings., .,"In many developing countries, the threat of nascent HIV epidemics expanding rapidly requires immediate and appropriate HIV prevention activities. Inexpensive and sustainable interventions are especially relevant in resource-constrained environments. In 2001, we assessed the prevalence and behavioral risk of sexually transmitted disease (STD) and HIV among at-risk populations in five developing countries in preparation for a community-randomized controlled trial, the NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial. Using a standardized protocol, more than 1000 participants in each country (China, India, Peru, Russia, and Zimbabwe) were selected by random sampling methods, completed a behavioral risk assessment, and provided biological specimens using a common laboratory protocol. Sample characteristics were studied within each country, and risk factors for HIV/STD acquisition were evaluated using logistic regression models. HIV rates were low (<1%) in China, India, Peru, and Russia but were high (26%) in rural Zimbabwe. STDs were generally twice as common in women as men, and serological evidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection was the most frequently detected STD. Behavioral data showed high rates of multiple partners in the Russian sample, and very low condom use rates in India and China. Among participants who reported ever having sex, female sex and having two or more sex partners were the factors most frequently associated with an increased risk of prevalent STD. Behavioral or biological risks were of sufficient magnitude in the locations selected in China, Russia, and Zimbabwe to implement the community-based randomized trial. Higher-risk subsets of community residents in India and Peru were identified before beginning the Trial.",2007,Apr,"AIDS (London, England)",21 Suppl 2,,S81-90,,10.1097/01.aids.0000266460.56762.84,17413267,#1374,,Exclusion reason: Data is not disaggregated by HIV status; ,""
